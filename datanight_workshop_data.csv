PEIRCE07_003_RAD.JPG SHOWN: Yellowing leaves on lemon trees to illustrate a question: ""What's happening to the lemon trees?"" The answer is lack of water, due to either drought or root rot from too much water. Photo shot in San Francisco, CA. on WEDNESDAY, May 31, 2006. (Katy Raddatz/The Chronicle) Photo taken on 5/31/06, in SAN FRANCISCO, CA. **Photo: Katy Raddatz
Q: My Meyer lemon at home -- planted in the ground -- looks as if it is dying. Its leaves are turning yellow and withering. I suspect root rot from too much water, but I don't know. The same appears to be happening to one in a planter on a nearby rooftop that I see from my office window.
A: As interesting as it is to contemplate a leaf-yellowing flu that is afflicting lemon trees, or perhaps a space alien that is sucking their sap, the answer is more likely to lie with watering practices. When a citrus tree can't get enough water from the soil, it develops yellow leaves with some wilting. Paradoxically, both overwatering and underwatering can cause these symptoms.
An overwatered tree often develops root damage from decay, so it can't bring in enough water. Our record six-week rain could have created this unhappy condition, especially if you have clay soil. If the damage isn't too severe, the tree is likely to recover if allowed to dry out for a while. You can purchase a water meter and use it to probe the soil a few inches down. Don't water until that soil is still moist but on the dry side, then water deeply.
Citrus trees in the ground will need water on the order of every two weeks in the dry season, but it depends on the type of soil and the weather. Also, be careful when you irrigate that you don't let the trunk stand in water, which can encourage disease.
The roof-garden citrus tree, in a container, is more likely to be suffering from dry soil. The smaller volume of soil in a container dries out faster than the open ground. If this is the problem, a containerized citrus tree should perk up within 24 hours after a thorough watering. Long, warm, windy spring days dry the soil fast, so you have to pay special attention to plants in containers.
Now, if the leaves of your tree are yellow between the veins while the veins themselves are still green, your problem is iron deficiency. This is caused by planting in soil that isn't acidic enough, so the plant can't absorb iron. Solve this problem by using a chelated iron fertilizer. Follow instructions on the label.
Q: This is my second year with an infestation of surreal grasshopper (scudder's bush katydids). They are happy to stay in my backyard and eat rose leaves and photinia shrubs. I need to kill them as opposed to spraying them off with water. I have been manually eliminating them and using insecticidal soap. Do you have any other suggestions? Possibly a repellant?
A: I picture a bucolic scene in which the charming, leaf-imitating katydids sing to you at night while gently munching a few rose leaves, but I'm sure it is in fact a scene of alarming devastation. The good news is that katydids have only one life cycle each year, so it should be possible to get ahead of their multiplication rate. Starting with ideas for repellants, consider buying hot pepper spray or making garlic oil spray. Here's the recipe: Add 3 ounces of minced garlic cloves to 1 ounce of mineral oil. Let stand for 24 hours or longer. Strain out garlic. Then add 1 teaspoon of fish emulsion and 1 tablespoon of castile soap to 16 ounces of water. Slowly mix the fish emulsion solution with the garlic oil and store in a glass container with a tight lid. To use, mix 2 tablespoons of the garlic oil mixture with 2 cups of water and spray.
Another substance that may serve to repel (and possibly kill) the insects is neem oil, but it may be most effective on the younger stages of the insect. If you try these treatments, experiment with only a part of your garden, say one rose plant, so you can see if it works.
In any case, I recommend that you take action later in the year to reduce the number of eggs that live through the winter. It is probable that the species you have lays its eggs between layers of leaves, creating a small, slightly raised and discolored blister. If you defoliate your roses in winter, as many do to encourage dormancy and reduce the occurrence of diseases, you will be removing katydid eggs as well. Be sure to rake up all the fallen leaves as they could be harboring katydid eggs.
In the spring, look for the young nymphs to start hatching and act quickly to repel or kill the pests while they are small. One possibility is to spray them with a half-cup of molasses in a quart of water, which kills grasshoppers and might kill katydids, too. Or, if by chance you could borrow some chickens for a few weeks as the insects are hatching, they would probably clean up your yard nicely while offering fresh eggs in return.","The yellowing of leaves on lemon trees is caused by lack of water, due to either drought or root rot from too much water.

What are some basic tips for training a new dog?,"A new dog is always an exciting addition to your family. They are lovable, incredibly loyal and can be a joy to be around. However, this can take a little bit of work in the form of training. If you think you’re going to get a perfect, well-behaved and trained dog from the start, you might be in for a rude awakening.
It can often take weeks, or even months, of work to train your dog to the level you are comfortable with. Also, not all dogs will take well to training and the process can be difficult, especially for new dog owners. In an effort to help those who might be struggling, or who have never trained a dog before, this article is going to go over some helpful dog training basics.
Use Treats, But Don’t Rely on Them Forever
One of the most powerful tools you have as a dog owner are treats. There are few things dogs love more than treats, and offering treats as a reward (or bribe) is often an easy way to get the dog to exhibit the behaviors you want. This makes treats a great tool to use during training. Rewarding a desirable action by your dog is a great way to encourage them to repeat the behavior.
You can even use treats for training when you are gone from the home. There now exist cameras that not only let you check in on your dog when you’re out, but they can also dispense treats. If you’re interested in learning more, be sure to check out this link: Furry Friends Gear / dog camera that dispenses treats.
However, it is important to use the treats more as a reward, than as a bribe. Keep treats hidden until they have completed the desired action, so they aren’t only completing the action to get the treat. You will eventually want to stop using treats altogether once the dog will complete the action without needing the reward.
Be Patient and Stay Positive
Having patience is always important, but this is especially true when training your dog. It would be nice if dogs learned how to be perfectly behaved in a matter of hours, but that is not the case. It can sometimes take months for dogs to be trained on certain things like where to do their business or how to obey commands.
All dogs learn at their own pace, and it is important to give them time. Trying to rush your dog, getting upset or simply giving up will only extend the time it takes to train them, so it is best to stay calm, patient and positive. If you notice yourself getting frustrated with your dog, it is best to cut the training session short and try a bit later.
Keep Your Dog Focused
Ensuring that your dog can stay focused during the training is also important. Dogs, especially young puppies, are notorious for getting distracted by noises, other pets, moving objects or even their own reflection. If your dog is constantly being distracted during training, they simply won’t be able to absorb the information you are trying to pass on to them.
Try to train at a time that is quiet, and in a room with minimal distractions. Also, training your dog in short 15-minute sessions is another good way to ensure they stay focused. If the training sessions are too long and drawn out, the dog could become restless or simply begin to be uncooperative.
Training a dog can be a difficult task, but the basic tips covered in this blog post will surely help. By using treats, be patient and making sure your dog stays focused, training your dog doesn’t have to be difficult.","Some basic tips for training a new dog include using treats as a reward but not relying on them forever, being patient and staying positive, and ensuring that your dog can stay focused during the training.

What are the three words that govern the creation of humans in Aldous Huxley's vision of the future in Brave New World?,"Engineered to perfection
I finally got around to finishing my listen through of Brave New World. It’s certainly deserving of its place on numerous ‘must read’ lists, a fact which was increasingly evident the more and more engrossed I became. I first discovered the book upon researching the beautifully evocative song of the same name and quickly became aware of the novel’s status as a classic. Having already discovered my fascination with the dystopian genre in George Orwell’s Nineteen-Eighty-Four, it was the next logical progression.
Aldous Huxley’s vision of the future takes place several hundred years on and is certainly a terrifying one. Although, its underlying problems are not all together evident immediately. The opening few chapters of the book deal with the new age process of reproduction, how the need for mothers has been completely eradicated by biological science and technology. Parents no longer exist. Humans are born outside the womb, in perfectly controlled conditions. Disease is no longer an issue. An unorthodox situation for a culture so rooted in family values like us to consider but perhaps not altogether awful. Imagine if we could breed ‘perfect’ humans, immune to all known diseases? Not such a bad thing. Of course, truths begin to emerge that ‘perfect’ humans are not created, despite having the ability to do so. “Community, identity, stability”. The three words which the govern the creation of humans of varying mental capacity, those made for express purposes. Those who will be born laborers and those who will die laborers. Conditioned from birth to accept whatever values are required of them. And so the framework for a fascinating tale is laid.
While Nineteen-Eighty-Four and Brave New World are similar in many ways, their differences are much more striking. As a pair of dystopian books, they complement each other extremely well. Both describe a suppressed society, but the manner in which this ultimate goal is accomplished differs wildly. In Orwell’s vision, the people’s freedom is forcibly taken from them. In Huxley’s, the desire for such freedom simply does not exist. Orwell controls the population with fear, while Huxley does it with kindness. I suppose it begs the question, does being directly controlled and manipulated even matter when one is happy? I would argue yes, it does matter. Manufactured happiness isn’t really happiness at all.
This was supposed to be a ‘review’ of sorts, although it quickly degenerated into something else entirely. Suffice to say, Huxley’s imagination of the future is one worth indulging, almost essentially so.
If you’re interested in dystopias, you might wanna try reading Zamyatin’s “We.” It’s the novel that inspired Orwell to write 1984, and it is fantastic.
With regards to “Brave New World,” I’d rather have knowledge than innocent happiness. It kind of reminds me of the story of the Garden of Eden–blissful paradisaical ignorance, or knowledge with all of its flaws?
I’ve heard of ‘We’ actually, it’s on my ever growing ‘to read’ list! I agree with you, knowledge with all it’s flaws is a heavy burden to carry but most definitely preferable to being shielded from the truths of the world.","The three words that govern the creation of humans in Aldous Huxley's vision of the future in Brave New World are ""Community, identity, stability"".",good,

Who was the pitcher for the Elk River Pioneers who injured his ankle during a practice?,"The Elk River Pioneers took a 16-5 drubbing from St. Michael on Friday night in a game where the winner would clinch advancement to next week’s super-regional.
The Pioneers (16-10), by virtue of starting the Section 2 playoffs with two wins, have another chance to advance on Sunday when they play whichever team survives Saturday’s sudden-death round — Albertville, Big Lake, Champlin or Anoka — starting 1 p.m. The top two teams in the eight-team tournament advance.
The team had a key setback Wednesday evening when pitcher Ben Hendrickson turned his left ankle at the end of a practice when he slipped on the tarp while running behind home plate. Henrickson had pitched a 2-1 win over Anoka last Sunday. The former Milwaukee Brewer who joined the team this year after three years out of pro ball had a 2-2 record, 2.19 ERA, and 67 strikeouts in 41 innings. In addition to his two wins, the team won three other games he started and lost another 1-0.
When Hendrickson showed up on crutches before the game, the team knew he wasn’t available.
St. Michael collected 19 hits — two doubles, 17 singles — against Josh Juntunen, Jim Brown and Lance Johnson. Juntunen took the loss, giving up 12 runs (eight earned) in 3 1/3 innings. Brown gave up two runs in 2 2/3 innings and Johnson one run in one inning.
Blake Schirmers was 3-for-5 with five RBI for St. Michael. Bobby Kneefe (three RBI) and Carl Sorenson were each 4-for-5.

What are some of the best practices a web designer can incorporate into their client discovery and web design process to avoid unnecessary revisions and conflicts?,"According to Adobe, 59% of global consumers would rather engage with content that’s beautifully designed as opposed to simply designed. Additionally, they reported that nearly 9 out of 10 mobile users would switch devices or stop viewing content altogether if it fails to meet their quality, length, and formatting expectations.
Needless to say, if you are a web designer, you have a lot on your plate. After years of both professional and self-taught training, clients depend on you to meet their vision and ensure that their customers will appeal to the overall design, responsiveness, and functionality of your design. If not, you will face excessive revisions — or worse, lose a client.
Handling Client Feedback
You spend months working on a website, agonizing over every detail. You anticipate the deadline, so assured and confident that the client will love the final mockup. You form a grin, click “send,” and wait for the accolades to start pouring in.
Then you get an email that says, “I don’t like this direction.” or “This is not what I had in mind.”
No matter how long you’ve been in the web design industry, one of the most daunting feelings is handling client feedback. In situations where a client seeks revisions, you must tread lightly because showing any signs of aggravation would risk losing the project.
The best way to go about web design revisions is to establish a system. This system can be integral to your success, and without it, you might waste countless hours performing changes.
1. It starts with getting to know your client before starting the web design process.
When you get a client whose budget is over the moon, it’s easy to get caught up in the moment and start making unwise decisions. As a web designer, you must understand the needs, wants, and goals of a client to avoid revision requests altogether.
The goal is to get inside your client’s head at the very beginning of the project to come across fewer problems later in the process. Take the time to thoroughly discuss not only the client’s vision for the website but also the functionality it needs. This will ultimately limit or eliminate the need for extensive revisions.
For instance, if you agreed to a five-page site and realized towards the end of the project that one of those pages should function as a blog with its own comment section, search bar, and category archive sub-pages — you will have a major revision problem in your hands. Always remember to be unassuming when it comes to what the client wants. Ask questions and have the right conversations before you start designing to help you avoid these types of unnecessary surprises and revisions.
2. Seal the deal by signing a contract.
After discussing the ins and outs of the web design project, you need to put all of it in writing. A contract should elaborate the scope of the project, the costs, and how you will handle future revisions. Don’t hesitate to include a specific number of revisions with your quote, or opt to charge an hourly rate for any changes. Have your own policies as a professional web designer.
Detailing your revision policies in the contract will ultimately set parameters for the project and give you a point of reference, should the client begin making excessive requests.
3. Showcase your sense of honesty and diplomacy.
Revisions are part of any creative’s job, but you should also explain to a client that extra charges are inevitable when requests go beyond the scope of what they are paying you. For instance, when a client asks for more revisions, you can tell them that you’re happy to make the change and add it to the bill.
It’s also crucial to walk a client through the changes to help them understand why you need to add extra charges. Communication is a powerful tool for both conflict management and contract negotiation, among other things. Let’s say towards the end of the project, the client asks for unrealistic revisions. You can say, “No, that’s not possible because…,” which can come off extremely negative. It’s better to choose your words carefully and say, “Yes, we could definitely do that, and it’ll cost you this much extra because….” This way, you either extend the project and expand your earnings, or make it crystal clear that their request is unfeasible — but in a positive light.
A Word of Advice
Once you incorporate these best practices into your client discovery and web design process, the project should be smooth sailing. But don’t expect the same results for every client and project — that’s just the reality of it. Remember, the best thing you can do during the initial phase is to discuss and define each goal thoroughly. Before you embark on a new web design project, it’s imperative that both you and your prospective client are on the same page.
Additionally, it wouldn’t hurt to be selective. When choosing to work with a client, try to look for characteristics that serve as hints on how well your working relationship will be. You should examine the following:
- How passionate are they about the project?
- Are they haggling before you even begin to bounce ideas?
- Do they have a clear picture of their own goals?
- Are they willing to take your professional advice?
- Are they showing an interest in working with you specifically?
In general, if the client shows hesitation or a lack of understanding of their own project needs and goals, you should consider turning them down. After all, it’s your time and talent that’s on the line.

What is the author's view on traditional gender roles in marriage?,"Someone please give the woman in this picture a drink.
4 Comments:
it is still to small to see. but what is so funny about it. whats wrong with wanting to be a good wife? didn't you say you were married before?
I'll see if I can adjust it to make the image larger. In the meantime, there's nothing wrong with wanting to be a good wife. It's just that the definitions of both ""good"" and ""wife"" need to be evaluated. This guide I've posted here was published in 1955, and the definitions of those words are pretty antiquated by now--which is what's humorous to me. Well, I'd like to think they're antiquated, but are they? I'm not always so sure.
Yes, I was married before, and I could not be a good partner for my then-husband, because it wasn't the right life for me to be living. However, the partner I
had hoped to be when I first got married looked nothing like the woman in this guide here, nor did my ex expect me to be like that. These ideals from 1955 are false and misogynistic, claiming that the wife is subservient to and less important than the husband. That's pure bullshit, and anyone who still strives for these ideals today has been brainwashed. It's sad.
Of course, lesbians and gays are doing all we can to make it legal to marry. However, I think one of the real reasons it's such a struggle is that when gay marriage finally becomes a national reality (and it someday will, even if not for decades), the public will not be able to just drop each person in the marriage into a pre-formed identity like ""husband"" or ""wife"" and, unfortunately, people are always most uncomfortable when they cannot categorize other people.
Incidentally, let me say that that is definitely a benefit to being gay: there are no traditional gender roles expected of either partner in a relationship. I do hope to eventually have a life-long partnership, a marriage, though it obviously won't look anything like the ""Good Wife's Guide"" here.
I would gladly go back to the submissive days if I didn't have to work. I would love to stay home and look 'pretty' for when my husband came home and all I did was cook all day. now maybe I have a Donna reed picture in my head but I think that there were better families, lower divorce rate and much less stress in general.
Obviously we differ in this view b/c for one I am not a feminist.
But I appreciate your honesty and the fact that you post your true feelings.
Oh I do have another question. Why do you keep in contact w/ your old girlfriend? I just figure she hurt you so why bother. Screw her, don’t' give her the satisfaction of talking to her.
One more question sorry - do you still talk to your ex husband? Did you get divorced b/c you realized that you weren’t being true to yourself and that you were gay? Did you always know? Sorry so many questions you just really have me thinking.
Don’t answer if you don't feel like it. I know they are pretty personal questions.
Actually, it's a myth that there was a lower divorce rate back in those ""simpler"" times. That's propaganda. Anyway, just because a marriage lasts, doesn't mean both people in it are happy. And, no, women were not happier then because they didn't ""have"" to work. Not ""having"" to work doesn't mean you have a simpler life; it means you have less control over your life. It means you don't make your own money. It means you are not able to pursue your own interests and strengths. It means you let other people make your decisions for you. It means all women are meant for the same things in life: being wives and having babies (there's nothing wrong with either of those, if it's what you truly want and you aren't giving up your identity to have them). It means your entire life is about making someone else's dreams come true (your husband's), not your own. It's a cop out. It means the work you do---raising children, keeping house--isn't appreciated or seen as real work (which it is). Staying home to look ""pretty"" for your husband makes you a sexual object, not a human being with a brain. Don't use marriage as a way to justify not wanting to work or not liking your career.
And there is nothing wrong with being a feminist, so don't approach it like it's a dirty word. The backlash over the past couple decades has made women feel it's wrong or ""unladylike"" to be a feminist. All feminism means is the belief that women are individuals, just as men, who should have the same opportunities and choices that men have (which we still don't have, despite what some would let you think). It is not about man-bashing or being anti-marriage or being a lesbian. It is simply about making sure women have choices in life.
I'm not trying to sound confrontational or mean, but this is a very important and emotionally charged topic for me, and I get really tired of women who have been brainwashed to think it's ok to be an object placed on this earth to make men's lives better, rather than their own.
Yes, I did end my marriage because I realized I'm gay, not exclusively because I'm a feminist or anti-marriage or anything like that. My ex-husband is a great person and was a great partner. But don't categorically lump my sexual orientation together with my being a feminist. Many straight, happily-married women feel the same way I do about feminism and the idea of gender roles.

Don't get me wrong - I sympathise with ret pallies on this nerf and I think it's a bad change, and I hope Blizzard fixes the problem post-haste. But ret is merely one of three trees, and you're not going to get much sympathy by dismissing us Holy and Prot pallies as 'not the way it should be played'.

"What happens to Kevin James' character in the movie ""True Memoirs of an International Assassin""?","Where to Stream:True Memoirs of an International Assassin
True Memoirs of an International Assassin isn’t going to change your opinion of Kevin James.
The new Netflix film stars James as an office drone by day/writer by night whose life gets turned upside down when his fiction novel about a deadly assassin gets published as a nonfiction novel and he is (naturally) mistaken for a deadly assassin.
Hilarity, you guessed it, ensues.
If you generally enjoy Kevin James’ madcap shenanigans and didn’t instantly think “Does Google not exist in this movie?” when you read that last sentence, you will probably like this film. If you rolled your eyes with the antipathy of 1,001 Paul Blarts forced to deal with a cadre of meddlesome teens at a poorly air-conditioned food court, this movie probably won’t be your particular brand of whiskey if you’re picking up what I’m putting down. Nobody is on the fence about Kevin James. I highly doubt there’s someone out there thinking, “I’ll wait until after Paul Blart: Mall Cop 3 until I render my final verdict on the case of Me vs. Liking Kevin James.”
And if by some chance you actually are having those thoughts, you’re not even the number one Paul Blart: Mall Cop fan, buddy.
For the most part, True Memoirs of an International Assassin is exactly what you’d expect from a Kevin James comedy, but there is one small detail that made the film immensely more enjoyable: the use of Spanish-language versions of American pop songs.
After Kevin James’ character is mistaken for an international assassin known as “The Ghost,” he’s kidnapped and transported to Venezuela where he is repeatedly ordered to kill a number of people. These exchanges usually go something like this:
Sometimes Andy Garcia/Sometimes another character: I want you to kill Corrupt Person A.
Kevin James: I really don’t want to kill Corrupt Person A.
SAG/SAC: If you kill Corrupt Person A, we will let you go home.
Kevin James: But I’m not an assassin.
SAG/SAC: Yes you are. Kill Corrupt Person A or we’ll kill you.
Kevin James: Okay.
This happens somewhere between three and fifty times.
But as Kevin James — who I must once again reiterate people believe to be an international assassin because his book was labeled as non-fiction — goes from character to character receiving orders to kill a different person like some kind of malfunctioning Rube Goldberg Assassination Machine, we’re treated to catchy Spanish-language versions of Taylor Swift’s “Shake It Off,” Phil Collins’ “In The Air Tonight,” and The Clash’s “Should I Stay or Should I Go” that imbue the scenes with some much-needed verve. But music supervisor Julianne Jordan, who’s worked in the music department for films like Pitch Perfect, Sisters, and Mr. & Mrs. Smith, saved the best for last.
As the film reaches its conclusion and Kevin James is about to head off into the “and he lived happily ever after” sunset, a Spanish-language version of The Outfield’s seminal ’80s classic “Your Love” begins to play. While most of the songs from the sensational soundtrack are unfortunately unavailable, this one (and Duran Duran’s “Hungry Like the Wolf”) can be found online.
Enjoy!

What amenities were lacking in the hotel according to the visitor's experience?,"Would you like to save as your currency permanently or for this visit only?
very helpful stuff! wonderful nature and place. strongly recommended it was very splendid place
It is in nice surroundings, large free parking. It is hardly a hotel, rather some B&B. There is no fridge, no airconditioning (was very hot in rooms when we arrived), no towels, no soap, etc. TV has 3 or 4 channels only, all in German. It was very laud at evening due to some group of kids, making early sleep impossible. Breakfast is a competition, who gets up early then he/she has a chance, because nobody is taking care if there is something left to eat, after 10am there was nothing, not even caffee cups.
Parking was large and free, not much more if I can recall. For the start we had to get rid of two spiders (at least inch big) sitting on the ceiling. No towels, no soap, no refrigerator. Room was very hot, but when we opened window we had immediate attack from army of mosquitos. Breakfast would be fair is there would be someone to resupply food, we had only caffee - nothing else was left, even if we were there quite early. There is no restaurant in place and we had to drive 10km to find anything to eat at evening.
Nothing Everything about the quiet, incomplete breakfast
room was very small..
The hotel was very clean, and beautiful. The breakfast was good.
Restaurant and sauna are very good. Not mentioning that sauna comes at no additional charge. There's a solarium as well. There was a bridge construction site next to the hotel which would block you just a few meters from the hotel car park. There's no way to cross this site on a vehicle, so you have to go around the whole city to get to the hotel from the other side. Though this construction has been on for a while, there's no indication about it in hotel description. So it was quite a challemge to get to the hotel in the night. We managed to do that only thanks to hotel staff member who agreed to show the way around the city.","The hotel lacked a fridge, air conditioning, towels, soap, and a sufficient number of TV channels. There was also a restaurant in place.",bad,"The context explicitly states that there is no restaurant in place and guests had to drive 10km to find food in the evening.

Quinoa - Super Food
Quinoa (the name is derived from the Spanish spelling of the Quechua name kinwa) originated in the Andean region of Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia and Peru, where it was domesticated 3,000 to 4,000 years ago for human consumption, though archaeological evidence shows a non-domesticated association with pastoral herding some 5,200 to 7,000 years ago.","Australian Organic Network Pty Ltd is a certified organic food specialist, offering a wide range of wholesale bulk and packaged Australian grown and imported certified organic foods.",good,
What is the concern of Leeds United fans regarding the club's management and ambition?,"Leeds United Message Board

All quiet on the transfer front Andy, nary a sound of pen scribbling over the proverbial dotted line. The dust of anticipation falls slowly at the close of another day. Disappointment and futility sinks in as thousands of faithful fans search the media in vain for elusive news . Oh what the hell, nothing new then. For we are Leeds and hope is in short supply these days but as ever the glass of wishful thinking should always remain half full,slurp, slurp .Yet in this time of stagnation and woe let’s spare a thought and raise a glass for our nearest but not dearest neighbours, Pillbottle Town.

Lack of ambition will destroy the club as surely as eggs are veggs! The lack of ambition will stop players wanting to come and speed up players wanting to leave! All players want to be seen to be in a winning and ambitious team its good for their market value! Nobody want to sell themselves short, or?
As you say what defines a big club? Well I still see us as a giant, no not a sleeping one, we have proved that given success,we can fill the ground and probably match the geordies 50k which would put us up with the big boys, I still see us as a top 6 club, but you need to be ambitious.
Tom, I think the old fashioned phrase was ""it's come to a pretty pass"". It has come to a pretty pass when Leeds supporters start to admire the ambition of their local rivals.
Bates and Grayson (Grayson in particular as an avowed Leeds fan) must know how they are winding up supporters with this repeat pattern of no news, no signings, false promises bullshit - it was the same last year and during the January transfer window this year. Why do you think they are doing it? Leeds' greatest asset is its fans and this management regime is not only pissing us off but driving us away - already there is talk on supporters' boards about boycotting games.
Bates may want to wait until 2013 (to suit his financial interests) before Leeds makes a serious push for promotion to the Premiership but we have the 2011/12 season to get through first. If nothing is delivered this coming term, he can forget any ambition he may have for the Club in the future; and forget platitudes about the glass being half full - the glass will be smashed!

Andy there’s nothing bad or disloyal in giving credit where credit is due. Maybe we would not be in such a state if SG had the same backing and support that Clarke had over the last couple of years. I remain optimistic about our future and see no virtue in the opposite. My glass will continue to be half full and will not be allowed to be spilled or smashed. I still believe SG is the man for the job. Judge him in two weeks time when funds will be replenished from the salaries saved from outgoing players. I have heard from a reliable source that a new shirt sponsorship deal has been secured and for a significantly larger sum than first anticipated.","Leeds United fans are concerned about the excessive ambition shown by the club's management.

What are some basic tips for training a new dog?,"A new dog is always an exciting addition to your family. They are lovable, incredibly loyal and can be a joy to be around. However, this can take a little bit of work in the form of training. If you think you’re going to get a perfect, well-behaved and trained dog from the start, you might be in for a rude awakening.
It can often take weeks, or even months, of work to train your dog to the level you are comfortable with. Also, not all dogs will take well to training and the process can be difficult, especially for new dog owners. In an effort to help those who might be struggling, or who have never trained a dog before, this article is going to go over some helpful dog training basics.
Use Treats, But Don’t Rely on Them Forever
One of the most powerful tools you have as a dog owner are treats. There are few things dogs love more than treats, and offering treats as a reward (or bribe) is often an easy way to get the dog to exhibit the behaviors you want. This makes treats a great tool to use during training. Rewarding a desirable action by your dog is a great way to encourage them to repeat the behavior.
You can even use treats for training when you are gone from the home. There now exist cameras that not only let you check in on your dog when you’re out, but they can also dispense treats. If you’re interested in learning more, be sure to check out this link: Furry Friends Gear / dog camera that dispenses treats.
However, it is important to use the treats more as a reward, than as a bribe. Keep treats hidden until they have completed the desired action, so they aren’t only completing the action to get the treat. You will eventually want to stop using treats altogether once the dog will complete the action without needing the reward.
Be Patient and Stay Positive
Having patience is always important, but this is especially true when training your dog. It would be nice if dogs learned how to be perfectly behaved in a matter of hours, but that is not the case. It can sometimes take months for dogs to be trained on certain things like where to do their business or how to obey commands.
All dogs learn at their own pace, and it is important to give them time. Trying to rush your dog, getting upset or simply giving up will only extend the time it takes to train them, so it is best to stay calm, patient and positive. If you notice yourself getting frustrated with your dog, it is best to cut the training session short and try a bit later.
Keep Your Dog Focused
Ensuring that your dog can stay focused during the training is also important. Dogs, especially young puppies, are notorious for getting distracted by noises, other pets, moving objects or even their own reflection. If your dog is constantly being distracted during training, they simply won’t be able to absorb the information you are trying to pass on to them.
Try to train at a time that is quiet, and in a room with minimal distractions. Also, training your dog in short 15-minute sessions is another good way to ensure they stay focused. If the training sessions are too long and drawn out, the dog could become restless or simply begin to be uncooperative.
Training a dog can be a difficult task, but the basic tips covered in this blog post will surely help. By using treats, be patient and making sure your dog stays focused, training your dog doesn’t have to be difficult.","Some basic tips for training a new dog include using treats as a reward but not relying on them forever, being patient and staying positive, and ensuring that your dog can stay focused during the training.

What is the main statement of the Equal Rights Amendment?,"March is Women’s History month. And today, March 8, is International Women’s Day. But here in the United States, women still do not have equal rights. In women’s marches, older women now hold signs that say “I can’t believe I still have to protest this fucking shit” and “My arms are tired from holding this sign since the 1960s.”
Nothing illustrates women’s inequality better than the failure of the Equal Rights Amendment to be ratified. It was first introduced in Congress almost a century ago in 1923.[1] But it took Congress 49 years to pass it.[2] For an amendment to become part of the Constitution, 2/3 of the state legislatures must then vote to ratify it. But only 37 states have done so – one vote short of the needed total. [3] In the 47 years since Congress passed it,[4] 13 states have refused to support women’s equality.
Even worse, five states have rescinded their ratification of the ERA.[5] Because it is unclear that states have the power to rescind a ratification, it remains to be seen if these actions set the ERA back even further.[6] Moreover, the original deadline for ratification of 1979 and an extension to 1982 has passed, so Congress would need to extend the deadline.[7] Recently, bills have been introduced to do just that.[8]
The latest state to fail to ratify the ERA is the Commonwealth of Virginia. In light of the scandals that have plagued three highest officials in the state,[9] including accusations of sexual assault,[10] this state could have improved its reputation by ratifying the ERA. Instead, it was never brought to a full vote before the Virginia legislature.[11]
What is so scandalous about this amendment that has made its passage impossible in almost a century? It says only this: “Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.”[12] It simply requires that men and women be treated equally. How can anyone oppose gender equality?
The opposition’s reasons for opposing the ERA consist mainly of quaint paternalistic notions that have been nullified with the passage of time and new laws. The latest reason is that “tax dollars could be used for abortion.”[13] In support of this argument, opponents cite a New Mexico state case, New Mexico Right to Choose/NARAL v. Johnson.[14] They claim that this case ruled that “since abortion is unique to women, restricting abortions is a form of sex discrimination.”[15] But that is not the ruling in this case. In fact, the ruling turned on medically necessary treatment, including abortion, being made available to women equally to men, not the fact that “abortion is unique to women.” 975 P.2d 841 (1998).
Opponents to the ERA also claim that supporters want to overturn all restrictions on abortions based purely on their rejection of pro-lifers’ proposed amendment to the ERA: “Nothing in this Article shall be construed to grant or secure any right relating to abortion or the funding thereof.”[16] But equal rights have nothing to do with abortion where only women can have an abortion. If men were being provided abortions and women were not, equal rights would have indeed required that abortions be provided to women in the same way. But of course that is not the case So this provision was rejected because it is irrelevant to the ERA.
Opponents make other claims as well. For example, they claim that women are paid 98% of men’s earnings and that these statistics are not meaningful because they do not consider occupation.[17] But when occupation is considered, the gap widens.[18]
They also claim that current laws are working and that women are already getting equal treatment. If that were true, why are they opposing a constitutional amendment that would merely formalize laws already in place? Perhaps it is because current laws are not working. Look at the Equal Pay Act.
Last, opponents of the ERA claim that it will end preferential treatment for women embedded in current laws, like those that benefit pregnant women.[19] This argument suffers from the same flaw as that for abortion – men cannot get pregnant so equal treatment between pregnant men and women is impossible. The ERA will not change that.
Opponents also claim without support that all bathrooms will be unisex if the ERA is enacted.[20] Equality is related to the number of bathrooms; it does not require the same bathroom.
If a person opposes the ERA, then that person believes that men and women are not equal. In the United States, the ceiling for women is not glass; it is clearly visible in the form of a Constitution that fails to provide for gender equality. Until the ERA is enacted, women are second-class citizens in this country.

What are some of the roles and responsibilities of Patricia Wallace at Oak View Elementary?,"HIGH POINT — A social worker at a local elementary school has earned special recognition for supporting children who need it the most.
Patricia Wallace, described as an “active and resolute advocate” for children at Oak View Elementary, recently received the $1,500 Debby Reynolds Award from The Enrichment Fund for the Guilford County Schools.
The Enrichment Fund for the Guilford County Schools is a nonprofit that provides financial support to enhance the educational programs of Guilford County Schools, helps students needing financial assistance, and encourages and rewards outstanding educators.
“No question about Ms. Wallace’s intense involvement advocating for children and the reason she is the award recipient,” said Carrie Little, president of the nonprofit. “What earned her the recognition is she advocates for all our students as if they were a part of her family.”
Annually, the Enrichment Fund presents The Debby Reynolds Award, providing $500 to an educator, counselor or other staff member who actively advocates for children in need. In addition, the award provides the recipient’s school with $700 to be used as needed by
the recipient and principal.
Wallace has a long connection to Oak View Elementary. Currently serving as the school’s social worker, she previously taught at the school and served as a substitute teacher and active parent.
As the school social worker, Wallace manages a clothing closet, oversees a food pantry, ensures students’ physical needs and coordinates the food backpack program for the school.
She also is the coordinator of Oak View’s Intervention Support Team, leading efforts to provide low-performing students with appropriate interventions to move them toward succeeding in school.
As the attendance team leader, Wallace works with families to reduce any barriers they confront in getting children to school every day.
“Ms. Wallace is a tremendous community resource, a dedicated person the families at Oak View — both present and past — know that they can count on to help them in any way that is needed,” Little said.

What are some of the benefits the author has experienced from their regular yoga practice?,"10 Important Things my Yoga Practice Taught Me.
Reflections from the yoga mat.
I was inspired by Kate Bartolotta’s recent post, So What Do Gomukhasana and Joseph Campbell Have in Common? This post got me thinking about what it is that I get from stepping onto my yoga mat almost every day.
Here’s what I came up with:
1. Unapologetic “me” time. My yoga practice requires me to step inside of my own skin and focus on myself. At so many other points throughout my day, I’m needed by my toddler. There are definitely times when I’ve wondered if my daily practice is selfish, but I come to the same conclusion over and over again. I am a better mother to her because I have this space for myself.
2. Health. I’ll be the first to admit that I came to my yoga practice for my body. Yet I don’t think I ever expected my physical self to ultimately be the last thing I hop onto my mat for. Still, there’s no denying that I love the body that my yoga practice has made—and I love the health and invigoration I feel both during my mat and during the rest of my daily life.
3. Self-growth. I have absolutely grown as a person because of my yoga practice. It’s forced me to confront my ego, my needs for control and perfection, and my deeply ingrained type-A personality—and I can’t believe how much of these self-defining qualities no longer define me because of my practice.
4. Patience. I’m certainly not a patient person, but I’m more patient than I used to be. I think part of this comes from simply working on poses that literally took me years to get into the full posture (or I’m still working on). My practice has also taught me to enjoy those poses between poses—better known as life.
5. Take time to be still. Some of my best practices involve me sitting in the same place on my mat; focusing on my breath or getting deeply into one posture and then holding it. I’ve taken this stillness out into my daily life, and for a hyperactive ADD person, this is a huge accomplishment, no medication required.
6. I’m not the same person every day, and that’s okay. I can be a really moody lady, and my mat has let me come to terms with this. During my yoga practice, I feel out how my body and my moods are shifting all the time—and I’ve learned that my life is often most successful when I acknowledge and accept my current situations rather than always swimming upstream.
7. Happiness is my responsibility. Sure, other people can affect our moods—but they don’t get credit for causing them. Your happiness is your responsibility, period. My yoga practice gets the credit for this realization because I learned how much power and control I have over myself from my mat time. Example: if I’m distracted during a balance pose, it’s not the fault of the girl in front of me in class, it’s mine. Another example: during my home practice, I can really take the time to reflect on how I feel in the present moment physically, emotionally, and mentally; and I’ve experienced the power in letting these feelings fall away as I just focus on flowing from pose to pose. Many times, all that ends up being left afterwards is ease and a deep sensation of tranquility.
8. My body is beautiful. No, I didn’t reach this conclusion because of the physical body that my practice sculpts. Rather, I’ve been able to find an appreciation for myself on a much deeper level and this has forced me to accept that quite often, the level of satisfaction we have with our outer bodies is directly connected to the level of satisfaction we have with ourselves internally.
9. Yoga exists off the mat. Ironically, having a regular practice of asanas has taught me to see the yoga that I practice constantly, when I’m no where near my mat.
10. Be open. A lot of Kate’s blog revolved around the need to open ourselves up. For me, this is probably the most impacting thing I’ve learned from my mat time. Through poses I thought I’d never access and then did, I’ve learned to be open to final outcomes that you never expected or even dreamed of. I’ve also learned that opening your heart to other people, and to your own self, is scary and vulnerable—but it’s necessary to live your existence to its fullest. Open your heart, even when it hurts; because otherwise you will not experience the full range of joy that life has to offer either.
Let me say that these are the most life-impacting things I’ve learned from my regular yoga practice. Are these going to be the same important things you gain from your mat time? Probably not, because you and I are not the same; and I think I could make that number 11—to get the most from your yoga practice you have to tune in and experience it yourself.
Fortunately and unfortunately, the best aspects of life cannot be taught—they have to be lived and experienced by you alone.
I do hope, however, that this list of lessons from my own personal experience has inspired you to figure out exactly what it is that you get from your own practice. Why, exactly, do you step on your mat?

Who scored the first touchdown for the Eagles in the NFC Divisional Playoff against the Giants?,"Our grades for the Eagles victory over the Giants in the NFC Divisional Playoff:
RUSHING OFFENSE
The Eagles averaged just 2.1 yards per carry, but they get points for again sticking with the run (28 attempts). Donovan McNabb scored the Eagles’ first TD on a QB sneak and Brian Westbrook set up the Eagles’ second TD with a 4-yard gain on a third-and-1 third-quarter toss play. Grade: C
PASSING OFFENSE
Donovan McNabb threw 2 interceptions and completed just 55 percent of his passes, but engineered two game-changing, third-quarter scoring drives that turned an 11-10 deficit into a 20-11 lead. He completed 9 of 16 passes for 93 yards and 7 passing first downs on those two drives. Grade: B-minus
RUN DEFENSE
Brandon Jacobs and Derrick Ward combined for 138 rushing yards, but the Eagles contained the damage and stopped them when they had to. DT Brodrick Bunkley spearheaded 2 huge fourth-and-one stops in the fourth quarter. Grade: B-plus
PASS DEFENSE
The Eagles effectively shut down the Giants’ passing game, holding Eli Manning to 5.8 yards per attempt, intercepting 2 passes, including 1 by Asante Samuel that set up the Eagles’ first touchdown, and held their fifth straight opponent without a passing TD. Grade: A
SPECIAL TEAMS
Ahmad Bradshaw gashed the Eagles for a game-opening 65-yard kickoff return that set up the Giants’ first points, but did a good job after that. Sav Rocca had a 40.0 net average and pinned the Giants at their own 11 on an important fourth-quarter punt. David Akers made all three of his field goal attempts. Grade: B
OVERALL
Once upon a time, the Eagles didn’t win many games in which Brian Westbrook managed just 46 rushing and receiving yards and Donovan McNabb threw 2 interceptions. But with a defense that hasn’t given up more than 14 points in the last 6 games, all bets are off. Grade: A-minus",Donovan McNabb scored the Eagles’ first TD on a QB sneak.,good,
What does the console property of the WorkerGlobalScope interface provide access to?,"WorkerGlobalScope.console
console read-only property of the
WorkerGlobalScope interface returns a
Console object providing access to the browser console for the worker.
Syntax
var consoleObj = self.console;
Value
Example
This property allows you to have access to a browser console for debugging purposes, inside a worker. So for example you could call
console.log('test');
inside a worker (which would basically be the equivalent of
self.console.log('test');, as these are being called on the worker scope, which can be referenced with
WorkerGlobalScope.self), to return a test message out to the browser console.
If you are calling
console.log() from a
DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope or other worker scope that acts on a single loaded window, that tab's web console will receive the logs. However, If you are calling
console.log() from a
SharedWorkerGlobalScope, the global browser console will receive the logs.
Note: Firefox has a bug with using
console.log inside shared/service workers (see bug 1058644), which may return strange results, but this should be fixed soon.

What is the theory of Panspermia and who first proposed it?,"A team of scientists from Sheffield University believe that they may have discovered extraterrestrial life. According to this story on MSN News a group from the University’s department of molecular biology and biotechnology under Professor Milton Wainwright sent a balloon 27 km up into the stratosphere during the recent Perseid meteor shower. The balloon was launched from Chester and came down near Wakefield. The balloon carried microscope studs, which were set to open between 22 and 27 km above the Earth. To ensure that the results were not contaminated by organisms from the Earth’s surface, the equipment was sterilised before it was launched.
When it returned, it was found that the studs had collected a variety of microscopic organisms. Some were diatoms, a form of algae, along with more unusual life-forms. Prof Wainwright said “It is generally accepted that a particle of the size found cannot be lifted from Earth to heights of, for example, 27km.!”
The team’s finding appears to corroborate the highly controversial views of the origin and evolution of life on Earth of the late Sir Fred Hoyle and his colleague, Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe. Panspermia is the theory that life originated in space and later colonised Earth. It was first put forward in the 19th century by the Swedish astronomer, Svante Aarhenius. In the late 1970s and early ’80s another creatures here on Earth.
Most controversially, they suggested in the last book. More speculatively still, they suggested that the seeding of such genetic material on Earth was done deliberately by advanced extraterrestrial civilisations. They suggested that these would artificial, machine intelligences from another cosmos in the multiverse..
This is not the first time a scientific balloon has returned from the stratosphere containing what was suggested was extraterrestrial microbial life. A few years a balloon sent up by scientists in India returned to Earth with red slime. Like Prof Wainwright, the Indian scientists believed this material had been collected from too high an altitude for it to have come from the Earth. They came to the conclusion that it must therefore have come from space. Fred Hoyle died twenty or so years ago in the 1990s. The media did contact Chandra Wickramasinghe, who was then working at Cardiff University, if I recall correctly. Prof Wickramasinghe was delighted that there was now further evidence to support his and Sir Fred’s theory.
Meanwhile, Prof Wainwright’s team intend to repeat the experiment in October, when there is a meteor shower associated with Halley’s Comet. This will spread further cosmic dust. If the balloon returns again with similar material, it will confirm the team’s theory.
All this is fascinating and highly controversial. I don’t think, however, there’s any remote chance of them finding anything like the horrific extraterrestrial disease in Michael Creighton’s book and film, The Andromeda Strain.

Welcome to Lightning Literature & Composition by Hewitt Homeschooling Resources -
I was very excited to get a chance to take a look at this popular program. It begins with the question....""Why read great literature?"" This course will give your student the answer to this question, and hopefully will have them answering ""For Pleasure!"".
The British Medieval Student Guide made a great first impression. It is organized very clearly, and you will be able to pick it up and dive right in - just what a busy homeschool mom with high schoolers needs!
There are 4 units with 2 lessons each. Introduction, Comprehension Questions, Literary Lesson and Writing Exercises. You can cover it in one semester or one full year (both schedules are outlined for you in the VERY affordable Teacher's Guide...you can't afford not to buy it for just $1.95!)
Since the Bentz Test Laboratory has just discovered this resource, we have not been following the Lightning Literature Scope & Sequence. We did not have a problem jumping right in to the highest level (even though my tester is just entering the 9th grade). It matches exactly where we are currently at in our history study.
My tester is an avid reader, and had no problem in reading the selections (several of them are family favorites already...)
The Comprehension Questions were just the right amount - I hate to kill the love of reading with having to answer too many written questions, don't you!
What he enjoyed the most was the Literary Lesson. For Beowulf he learned ""foreshadowing."" I appreciated that each literary element studied is clearly explained (to the student) in this section. I don't need to read the literature selection, or the Teacher Guide in order for my student to learn the concept. (Although, you will want to read their literature selections!)
The Unit concludes with a variety of Writing Exercises. Once again, the invaluable Teacher Guide gives you Grading Tips and Templates you won't want to miss.
The Introduction clearly defined literature and writing expectations. Additionally, several ""Activities to Enhance Your Study"" are recommended. My tester decided to keep a vocabulary notebook as part of his active reading.
The Appendix Section at the end of the Student Guide should not be overlooked. Discussion questions (great literature just begs for a great discussion!) Additional Reading Selections, and Schedules will all be valuable tools for your student!
I was very impressed with this course, you will want to check out the other levels of Lightning Lit & Comp, as well as , Hewitt Homeschooling Resource's other hand-picked products. (They offer a full 90 day return policy)

What are the three words that govern the creation of humans in Aldous Huxley's vision of the future in Brave New World?,"Engineered to perfection
I finally got around to finishing my listen through of Brave New World. It’s certainly deserving of its place on numerous ‘must read’ lists, a fact which was increasingly evident the more and more engrossed I became. I first discovered the book upon researching the beautifully evocative song of the same name and quickly became aware of the novel’s status as a classic. Having already discovered my fascination with the dystopian genre in George Orwell’s Nineteen-Eighty-Four, it was the next logical progression.
Aldous Huxley’s vision of the future takes place several hundred years on and is certainly a terrifying one. Although, its underlying problems are not all together evident immediately. The opening few chapters of the book deal with the new age process of reproduction, how the need for mothers has been completely eradicated by biological science and technology. Parents no longer exist. Humans are born outside the womb, in perfectly controlled conditions. Disease is no longer an issue. An unorthodox situation for a culture so rooted in family values like us to consider but perhaps not altogether awful. Imagine if we could breed ‘perfect’ humans, immune to all known diseases? Not such a bad thing. Of course, truths begin to emerge that ‘perfect’ humans are not created, despite having the ability to do so. “Community, identity, stability”. The three words which the govern the creation of humans of varying mental capacity, those made for express purposes. Those who will be born laborers and those who will die laborers. Conditioned from birth to accept whatever values are required of them. And so the framework for a fascinating tale is laid.
While Nineteen-Eighty-Four and Brave New World are similar in many ways, their differences are much more striking. As a pair of dystopian books, they complement each other extremely well. Both describe a suppressed society, but the manner in which this ultimate goal is accomplished differs wildly. In Orwell’s vision, the people’s freedom is forcibly taken from them. In Huxley’s, the desire for such freedom simply does not exist. Orwell controls the population with fear, while Huxley does it with kindness. I suppose it begs the question, does being directly controlled and manipulated even matter when one is happy? I would argue yes, it does matter. Manufactured happiness isn’t really happiness at all.
This was supposed to be a ‘review’ of sorts, although it quickly degenerated into something else entirely. Suffice to say, Huxley’s imagination of the future is one worth indulging, almost essentially so.
If you’re interested in dystopias, you might wanna try reading Zamyatin’s “We.” It’s the novel that inspired Orwell to write 1984, and it is fantastic.
With regards to “Brave New World,” I’d rather have knowledge than innocent happiness. It kind of reminds me of the story of the Garden of Eden–blissful paradisaical ignorance, or knowledge with all of its flaws?
I’ve heard of ‘We’ actually, it’s on my ever growing ‘to read’ list! I agree with you, knowledge with all it’s flaws is a heavy burden to carry but most definitely preferable to being shielded from the truths of the world.","In Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, the society is engineered to perfection, with humans born outside the womb in controlled conditions. This eradicates the need for mothers and eliminates disease, creating a culture vastly different from our own family-rooted values.",bad,"The output discusses the engineered society and reproduction process in Brave New World, which is related to the context, but it does not directly answer the question about the three words that govern the creation of humans. This makes the response plausible but flawed upon closer inspection."

You blinked!!!
Wow. A republican actually waking up and facing reality. A shock really ...
This is why we need redistricting that creates as many swing districts as possible. In solid districts, members are accountable to their parties more than the voters!
Let's see, do you want to extend the tax cut only 2 months.... or do you want it extended a Year? !
Democrats left Washington D.C. EARLY... that's why the fight over a 2- frickin'- month extension!
Republicans want Longer-term tax cut, One Year - so that Americans and businesses can plan better and have some certainty in their lives.
Lazy Democrats would rather go on Christmas break than give Americans a one-Year tax cut!
If Obama didn't do such a Horrible job the past 3 years, we wouldn't even be needing any payroll tax cuts, too.
this was and is a stupid Senate bill and there was no reason to blink. this is the problem with the Repubs they have no nerves! Obama does not need to accept anything on the Pipeline anyway .... do the Repubs really want to increase taxes during the election year! why in two month if not now! those guys are just hopeless .... if they can't play poker they should stay off the table!
Finally the wolf caught up with GOP.. You ain't fooling anybody anymore losers!
Guys, you fart around all year long on the budget, wind up passing a giant omnibus (which you promised not to do, by the way) and now that Schumer has given you the finger you express shock! at their behavior. You are dealing with Marxists. They lie and cheat and steal as a matter of course. It's all they know. You need to have your duckies in a row WELL before deadlines. Ideally, you'd attach such things to the funding of departments that they reeeeally want, like the EPA or NLRB. And hey, if that bill gets vetoed? Boo hoo, the EPA is shut down until further notice. Waah.
DocinPA: Waah.
______________________________________________________
Don't cry (patting your back) this is what the American people wanted. Don't you want your fellow Americans to be happy?
(looking into your eyes curiously)
Can you spell GOP obstruction?
All praise to constituents and not to tone-deaf tea party freshmen.
The Democrats and Republicans in the Senate voted by an overwhelming bipartisian majorty to ectend the tax credits; therefore it was their right to leave town. If Bush and the Republicans that were in control from 2000 to 2009, hadn't started unfunded wars, raised taxes and squandered the surplus that Democrat Bill Clinton haded them, we would NOT be in this mess.
NO President in US history has ever started one then two wars then lowered taxes and told everyone to go shopping. That is taught as a lesson in practical math and Civics. Who with an ounce of sense starts Tri$$ion Do$$ar wars, cuts taxes by another Tri$$ion Do$$ars, provides a Tri$$ion Do$$%ar drug program no one watned and then tell everyone to suppor the war by going shopping?
Republicans have no leaders, NONE and they have no leadership potential running for in the Republican primaries for President. John Boehner botched his day as Speaker and it has been down hill since. We the People elected Republicans to retake Congress in 2010 too providew the jobs they promised if elected, and they have failed us once again.
I voted for this digbat, Jaime Herrera.
That won't happen again.
Show them all the unemployment line.
That is absolutely not true. The truth is, the bagger congresspeople can't vote any piece of legislation on its merit without loading it down with a bunch of right wing extremist riders that they should know Dem voters and by extension, their senators and reps will reject. The filthy tar sands pipeline has absolutely nothing to do with tax cuts OR American jobs. It's going to take 2 months to negotiate all the nonsense out of this package before it's fit to pass for a whole year. You think by now, after the debt ceiling debacle they would know that dirty tricks backfire bigtime.
oops, sorry wilton, I see now that's not your quote. I actually agree with you
Anybody who compromises in any way at any time is a RINO!!!! Lets primary their butts right out of office!
We need to quickly squash the notion that this was only for two months, and then it was to go away. Someone on fox news said this last night, and people on the right are trying to say it over and over until it becomes the truth. (I couldn't change the channel in Wendy's). It was voted on by the senate so that they could come back and hammer out a deal that would take the tax cuts through the end of year. The Dems wanted a year also, but apparently the Sur tax on millionaires wound up killing that deal. I must say this, I'm dreading the next fight coming up in the next few months.
Not sure about Arkansas, but Sean Duffy from Wisconsin is hearing the uproar of his State's citizens to Scott Walker's over-reaching. He is smart to retreat because Wisconsin is going Democratic, in a big way. He Sean, if you want to survive the next election, run as a Moderate. Even so, it will be dicey because your fellow Repugs have made a mess there (also Ohio, and others). So, Sean think about it. Tea Partiers, bye bye. Enough of your stupid ""NO"" and pledge to some guy named Grover instead to the United States of America.
You are in an 11% or less minority with your opinion, do you know that? Think about why 89 of your fellow Republicans in the Senate voted YES. Just a suggestion, . . .
Lazy Democrats would rather go on Christmas break than give Americans a one-Year tax cut!
And house republicans are willing to give tax breaks to the wealthy without requiring the same kind of upfront funding they insist on for the unemployment benefits, payroll tax relief and medicare reimburse-ments. This latest battle is a result of the GOP's belief that hypocrisy and using two sets of standards regarding tax relief are acceptable practices in dealing with this issue.

"What happens to Kevin James' character in the movie ""True Memoirs of an International Assassin""?","Where to Stream:True Memoirs of an International Assassin
True Memoirs of an International Assassin isn’t going to change your opinion of Kevin James.
The new Netflix film stars James as an office drone by day/writer by night whose life gets turned upside down when his fiction novel about a deadly assassin gets published as a nonfiction novel and he is (naturally) mistaken for a deadly assassin.
Hilarity, you guessed it, ensues.
If you generally enjoy Kevin James’ madcap shenanigans and didn’t instantly think “Does Google not exist in this movie?” when you read that last sentence, you will probably like this film. If you rolled your eyes with the antipathy of 1,001 Paul Blarts forced to deal with a cadre of meddlesome teens at a poorly air-conditioned food court, this movie probably won’t be your particular brand of whiskey if you’re picking up what I’m putting down. Nobody is on the fence about Kevin James. I highly doubt there’s someone out there thinking, “I’ll wait until after Paul Blart: Mall Cop 3 until I render my final verdict on the case of Me vs. Liking Kevin James.”
And if by some chance you actually are having those thoughts, you’re not even the number one Paul Blart: Mall Cop fan, buddy.
For the most part, True Memoirs of an International Assassin is exactly what you’d expect from a Kevin James comedy, but there is one small detail that made the film immensely more enjoyable: the use of Spanish-language versions of American pop songs.
After Kevin James’ character is mistaken for an international assassin known as “The Ghost,” he’s kidnapped and transported to Venezuela where he is repeatedly ordered to kill a number of people. These exchanges usually go something like this:
Sometimes Andy Garcia/Sometimes another character: I want you to kill Corrupt Person A.
Kevin James: I really don’t want to kill Corrupt Person A.
SAG/SAC: If you kill Corrupt Person A, we will let you go home.
Kevin James: But I’m not an assassin.
SAG/SAC: Yes you are. Kill Corrupt Person A or we’ll kill you.
Kevin James: Okay.
This happens somewhere between three and fifty times.
But as Kevin James — who I must once again reiterate people believe to be an international assassin because his book was labeled as non-fiction — goes from character to character receiving orders to kill a different person like some kind of malfunctioning Rube Goldberg Assassination Machine, we’re treated to catchy Spanish-language versions of Taylor Swift’s “Shake It Off,” Phil Collins’ “In The Air Tonight,” and The Clash’s “Should I Stay or Should I Go” that imbue the scenes with some much-needed verve. But music supervisor Julianne Jordan, who’s worked in the music department for films like Pitch Perfect, Sisters, and Mr. & Mrs. Smith, saved the best for last.
As the film reaches its conclusion and Kevin James is about to head off into the “and he lived happily ever after” sunset, a Spanish-language version of The Outfield’s seminal ’80s classic “Your Love” begins to play. While most of the songs from the sensational soundtrack are unfortunately unavailable, this one (and Duran Duran’s “Hungry Like the Wolf”) can be found online.
Enjoy!

What are some of the benefits the author has experienced from their regular yoga practice?,"10 Important Things my Yoga Practice Taught Me.
Reflections from the yoga mat.
I was inspired by Kate Bartolotta’s recent post, So What Do Gomukhasana and Joseph Campbell Have in Common? This post got me thinking about what it is that I get from stepping onto my yoga mat almost every day.
Here’s what I came up with:
1. Unapologetic “me” time. My yoga practice requires me to step inside of my own skin and focus on myself. At so many other points throughout my day, I’m needed by my toddler. There are definitely times when I’ve wondered if my daily practice is selfish, but I come to the same conclusion over and over again. I am a better mother to her because I have this space for myself.
2. Health. I’ll be the first to admit that I came to my yoga practice for my body. Yet I don’t think I ever expected my physical self to ultimately be the last thing I hop onto my mat for. Still, there’s no denying that I love the body that my yoga practice has made—and I love the health and invigoration I feel both during my mat and during the rest of my daily life.
3. Self-growth. I have absolutely grown as a person because of my yoga practice. It’s forced me to confront my ego, my needs for control and perfection, and my deeply ingrained type-A personality—and I can’t believe how much of these self-defining qualities no longer define me because of my practice.
4. Patience. I’m certainly not a patient person, but I’m more patient than I used to be. I think part of this comes from simply working on poses that literally took me years to get into the full posture (or I’m still working on). My practice has also taught me to enjoy those poses between poses—better known as life.
5. Take time to be still. Some of my best practices involve me sitting in the same place on my mat; focusing on my breath or getting deeply into one posture and then holding it. I’ve taken this stillness out into my daily life, and for a hyperactive ADD person, this is a huge accomplishment, no medication required.
6. I’m not the same person every day, and that’s okay. I can be a really moody lady, and my mat has let me come to terms with this. During my yoga practice, I feel out how my body and my moods are shifting all the time—and I’ve learned that my life is often most successful when I acknowledge and accept my current situations rather than always swimming upstream.
7. Happiness is my responsibility. Sure, other people can affect our moods—but they don’t get credit for causing them. Your happiness is your responsibility, period. My yoga practice gets the credit for this realization because I learned how much power and control I have over myself from my mat time. Example: if I’m distracted during a balance pose, it’s not the fault of the girl in front of me in class, it’s mine. Another example: during my home practice, I can really take the time to reflect on how I feel in the present moment physically, emotionally, and mentally; and I’ve experienced the power in letting these feelings fall away as I just focus on flowing from pose to pose. Many times, all that ends up being left afterwards is ease and a deep sensation of tranquility.
8. My body is beautiful. No, I didn’t reach this conclusion because of the physical body that my practice sculpts. Rather, I’ve been able to find an appreciation for myself on a much deeper level and this has forced me to accept that quite often, the level of satisfaction we have with our outer bodies is directly connected to the level of satisfaction we have with ourselves internally.
9. Yoga exists off the mat. Ironically, having a regular practice of asanas has taught me to see the yoga that I practice constantly, when I’m no where near my mat.
10. Be open. A lot of Kate’s blog revolved around the need to open ourselves up. For me, this is probably the most impacting thing I’ve learned from my mat time. Through poses I thought I’d never access and then did, I’ve learned to be open to final outcomes that you never expected or even dreamed of. I’ve also learned that opening your heart to other people, and to your own self, is scary and vulnerable—but it’s necessary to live your existence to its fullest. Open your heart, even when it hurts; because otherwise you will not experience the full range of joy that life has to offer either.
Let me say that these are the most life-impacting things I’ve learned from my regular yoga practice. Are these going to be the same important things you gain from your mat time? Probably not, because you and I are not the same; and I think I could make that number 11—to get the most from your yoga practice you have to tune in and experience it yourself.
Fortunately and unfortunately, the best aspects of life cannot be taught—they have to be lived and experienced by you alone.
I do hope, however, that this list of lessons from my own personal experience has inspired you to figure out exactly what it is that you get from your own practice. Why, exactly, do you step on your mat?

Anytime me and my wife doing yoga, we feel much more relaxed and calm for a long time. I notice for me morning time is the best time to do yoga. I guess it's different for everyone.
Yoga has way more to it than getting a healthier body. While many people like myself will come to a Yoga class for getting a better body, I am pretty sure each of them do experience the spiritual aspects of it at some time if they stick to it. Over years of my Yoga practice, I have experiences huge range of benefits from Yoga. Thanks for summing up your Yoga experience in these ten beautiful points and sharing them here.","The author has experienced numerous benefits from their regular yoga practice, including unapologetic ""me"" time, improved health, self-growth, increased patience, the ability to be still, acceptance of daily changes, the realization that happiness is their responsibility, a deeper appreciation for their body, the understanding that yoga exists off the mat, and the importance of being open.",good,

What are your suggestions? What's the best portal for phpbb3 ?
Since I dont run it, I have no clue.. but it all depends on your likings, so you should try them, and if you like it keep it
There are several just depends on your experience level. IM Portal, Simple Portal, Stargate Portal, Integra Mod3.

Stargate :
IntegraMod
Simple Portal:
I would go to the Phpbb Website to find out more about this I say that because a lot of these come with the forum already in the package. And I personally do not know if an existing forum could be imported into them.
Another thing Google it that will bring up a lot.
I quite like the board3 portal:
It's also previously been validated by the phpBB team:
Are there anymore portal options for phpbb?
I've been thinking about helping a client setup a small phpbb forum and they'll want a portal or cms type system that they could show news similar to how we have our home page setup.
I think the Board3 Portal should serve that purpose, then again there are also other choices available out there as well
Is that this site here?
That looks pretty nice
I couldn't find the portal that I used years ago, I think it had an alien as their mascot or logo.
Does anyone still use phpnuke is a portal, I remember it being powerful?

What does the author believe is the key to creating a connection between the reader and the characters in a story?,"/>~ By Jim Cangany
There’s a line in John Green’s beloved The Fault in Our Stars that has rooted itself in my head and won’t go away. “That’s the thing about pain. It demands to be felt.”
Recently, I’ve been thinking a lot about that line and how it applies to romance writers. I think we’d agree that in romance, the hero, or heroine, or both, need to survive pain in some sort before they get to enjoy their happily-ever-after. The pain may be physical, if the paramedic heroine is injured while trying to save a child’s life, for example. It could emotional too, if the hero has lost the ability to trust after finding out his former spouse was cheating on him. The point is the pain has to be dealt with and overcome, or we’d be left with pretty boring stories.
So, as authors, where do we find that pain? Even more important, how do we transfer that pain to the page once we’ve found it? In my opinion, we don’t have to look far. A glance in the mirror will suffice. After all, who among us has not battled, and hopefully defeated, pain at one time or another? It could be anything from a stubbed toe to an extended stay in the hospital. He or she who has not felt pain has not truly lived.
Contemporary romance authors write stories about “real” people. While they may be more muscle-bound or have better hair than the majority of us in the flesh-and-blood world, those characters still struggle with the everyday struggles we face–sick children, aging parents, a friend’s unexpected death.
Our job as writers is to get the reader to care about our characters. What better way is there to create that connection than to draw on our own experiences? Sure we’re paid to make stuff up. But romance readers are smart, and can spot a lack of genuineness a mile away. (Just to be safe, I consulted the dictionary and genuineness is a real word. Trust me.)
When I wrote Fallen Star, the toughest scene for me to write was when E.J.’s mother passed away. Why was it so hard? It was difficult because to write the way it needed to be written, I went back to the time when my mom died. While my mom’s passing was much different from E.J.’s, the helplessness, the anguish, the pain was the same. I needed to channel all of those emotions into that scene to make sure it was a genuine as possible.
I was in tears when I finished writing that scene. But you know what? Readers have told me that sequence left them in tears, as well. That, my friends, is what it’s all about. When you’ve dug so deep into your own mine of troubles that the reader actually feels it too, then you’ve dug deep enough.
Given that nobody likes to revisit bad times, so one may ask why do it. I believe we should do it because as storytellers we are in the unique position to tell the truth. We are the ones who strip away the veneer to reveal what lies beneath. And when we have done so, and made our readers seethe in anger, or shed a tear in grief, we have made the payoff–the hero and heroine’s happily-ever-after–that much more worthy of celebration.
My editor has told me that I have a knack for making her cry. It’s an unusual compliment, but one of which I am quite proud. I’m proud of it because that means I’ve done my job well. I’ve searched within myself, brought forth some of that pain we all carry, and transferred it to the page in a way that someone else feels it.
The ability to have our words bring forth a specific emotional response from somebody we’ve never met is pretty darn cool. It may not be easy. It may not be fun. But it is so worth the heartache, because at the end of the story, when our hero and heroine have fought the good fight, that happily-ever-after they finally achieved is sweeter than a June strawberry.
So my challenge to my fellow authors is this–dig deep. And when in doubt, dig a little deeper. By doing so, I guarantee you’ll hit that vein of elusive emotional gold that can be so hard to find. And your readers will thank you for it. In closing, I’d like to leave you with an old Irish prayer that captures the essence of this topic quite elegantly, I think.
May God give you…
For every storm, a rainbow,
For every tear, a smile,
For every care, a promise,
And a blessing in each trial.
For every problem life sends,
A faithful friend to share,
For every sigh, a sweet song,
And an answer for each prayer.

Great post, Jim, and I loved that quote.
The Irish certainly have a way with words, don’t they Liz. I have a file of Irish saying for situations just like that.
Great post. There’s a huge difference between reading a sad scene as an outsider and feeling a sad scene as though you were the character experiencing the emotions. It sounds like you’ve mastered the latter.
Thanks, Veronica. I tend to wear my heart on my sleeve, so that helps, I think. 🙂","The author believes that the key to creating a connection between the reader and the characters in a story is to draw on the author's own experiences.

When was Thunder's new album “Robert Johnson’s Tombstone” released?,"Thunder’s new album “Robert Johnson’s Tombstone” is released on 30th October on STC Recordings (via Universal). The band will tour the UK in November to support the new release.
The band have played 2 UK tours, 2 European Tours, done lots of festivals and finished off with a triumphant appearance at the Monsters of Rock Festival in Milton Keynes in June. They’ve recently released their fourth self financed DVD – a double affair called “Thunder Go Mad In Japan” – which, as the title suggests, was filmed on tour in Japan in February 2006. Disc 1 contains a documentary of the trip, and Disc 2 features a full blown 2 hour show. Harry performed with Ian Gillan at the Teenage Cancer Trust show at). The campaign for the new LP is gathering pace, and full details of all their activities can be found as ever at.”
Formed at the turn of 1989, Thunder have enjoyed an eventful career that has thankfully witnessed more highs than lows. The release of “Robert Johnson’s Tombstone” finds the quintet on a very remarkable high, and in a position where they are pretty much masters of their own destiny.
Having known each other since they were 11 and been playing in bands together since they were 15, Danny and Luke knew exactly what they were going for when they began demo-ing tracks with Duran Duran guitarist Andy Taylor producing. With Harry James occupying the drum stool, bass player Mark “Snake” Luckhurst and guitarist/keyboardist Ben Matthews swiftly joined the trio, and by this time a record deal had been inked with EMI. Debuting in front of a mere 35 punters at a gig in Southend in July 1989, they did a handful of shows before the band entered the studio with Taylor and engineer Mike Fraser (Bryan Adams, Aerosmith etc) to cut their first magnificent offering in the shapely form of debut album 'Backstreet Symphony'. More touring followed, including two dates at the NEC in Birmingham opening for Aerosmith, and the band's fondness for the road would only increase their popularity. “In our previous band Terraplane,” notes Luke, “we never got any support from radio and TV and with Thunder we just assumed the worst. So”/Fraser produced second album, 'Laughing On Judgement Day' was released in August 1992 (held off the Number One spot in the UK's album chart only by a Kylie Minogue greatest hits package).
However, the tour to support 'Laughing On Judgement Day' (which included headlining dates in the UK and a European tour supporting Extreme) proved a step too far for bassist Snake. He quit after Japanese dates.….
“I don't think we were particularly affected by Grunge in terms of musical influence,” reckons Luke. .
The band's first official live album, 'Live', hit the stores in February 1998 and the quintet toured the UK once again, and doing another couple of bits for charity by abseiling off of the side of the Tyne Bridge in Newcastle for the British Lung Foundation (not Luke - he hates heights), and doing a freefall parachute jump (Danny & Ben). Thunder are, of course, no strangers to charity, having organised several highly publicised gigs in aid of CRISIS in the past. Surprisingly, eight months after the release of the next studio album, 'Giving The Game Away', in 1998, Thunder announced a split due to “outside business forces”, going out in typical style with a series of farewell shows, climaxing with two gigs at Dingwalls in Camden on May 4 and 5 2000.
Danny “We’d been at it solidly for eleven years, we were still doing great touring business and we were solid as a unit, but we felt frustrated. There didn't seem to be any room for us to operate outside of our own fanbase..
“I'd had the idea of the 'Monsters Of Rock' tour and took the concept to Clear Channel. I convinced them it was a workable thing to do, thinking that my role would be behind the scenes, and just walking around telling people what to do!
“But they felt Thunder should reform and be on the bill. ‘It would be great for ticket sales’, they said. settled on an EP to start with. When the news got out, we were offered record deals, but with the advances in technology and the internet,...”
“The thing is, we never fell out, we’d all remained good friends,” continues Luke.  'Back For The Crack' EP sold incredibly well, as did the 'Shooting At The Sun' album. Amazingly the fans were still there and they’ve continued to grow throughout the campaign for 'The Magnificent Seventh', and all the touring we’ve done with it”
Indeed. Onward and upward and there's clearly no chance of Thunder joining the derelict old barflies up on Boot Hill just yet!
Luke “There was a period just after the whole Brit-Pop thing in the late 90s when we were truly out of sorts. But rock is back, and we're having a great time, and what’s even better, now we’re doing it all on our own terms.”
Danny “There’s no doubt it’s very hard work doing this all ourselves, but the rewards are there with each record selling more than the last, so we can see the curve going upwards, and it's great not to have to deal with all the record label bullshit, now it’s my bullshit, and everyone else has to deal with it!”",Thunder's new album “Robert Johnson’s Tombstone” was released on 30th November.,bad,"The context clearly states that the album was released on 30th October, but the corrupted output incorrectly states the release date as 30th November, which directly contradicts the provided information."
What is the concern of Leeds United fans regarding the club's management and ambition?,"Leeds United Message Board
Deals or No Deals?..That is the question.
All quiet on the transfer front Andy, nary a sound of pen scribbling over the proverbial dotted line. The dust of anticipation falls slowly at the close of another day. Disappointment and futility sinks in as thousands of faithful fans search the media in vain for elusive news . Oh what the hell, nothing new then. For we are Leeds and hope is in short supply these days but as ever the glass of wishful thinking should always remain half full,slurp, slurp .Yet in this time of stagnation and woe let’s spare a thought and raise a glass for our nearest but not dearest neighbours, Pillbottle Town.

Lack of ambition will destroy the club as surely as eggs are veggs! The lack of ambition will stop players wanting to come and speed up players wanting to leave! All players want to be seen to be in a winning and ambitious team its good for their market value! Nobody want to sell themselves short, or?
As you say what defines a big club? Well I still see us as a giant, no not a sleeping one, we have proved that given success,we can fill the ground and probably match the geordies 50k which would put us up with the big boys, I still see us as a top 6 club, but you need to be ambitious.
Tom, I think the old fashioned phrase was ""it's come to a pretty pass"". It has come to a pretty pass when Leeds supporters start to admire the ambition of their local rivals.
Bates and Grayson (Grayson in particular as an avowed Leeds fan) must know how they are winding up supporters with this repeat pattern of no news, no signings, false promises bullshit - it was the same last year and during the January transfer window this year. Why do you think they are doing it? Leeds' greatest asset is its fans and this management regime is not only pissing us off but driving us away - already there is talk on supporters' boards about boycotting games.
Bates may want to wait until 2013 (to suit his financial interests) before Leeds makes a serious push for promotion to the Premiership but we have the 2011/12 season to get through first. If nothing is delivered this coming term, he can forget any ambition he may have for the Club in the future; and forget platitudes about the glass being half full - the glass will be smashed!

Andy there’s nothing bad or disloyal in giving credit where credit is due. Maybe we would not be in such a state if SG had the same backing and support that Clarke had over the last couple of years. I remain optimistic about our future and see no virtue in the opposite. My glass will continue to be half full and will not be allowed to be spilled or smashed. I still believe SG is the man for the job. Judge him in two weeks time when funds will be replenished from the salaries saved from outgoing players. I have heard from a reliable source that a new shirt sponsorship deal has been secured and for a significantly larger sum than first anticipated.","Leeds United fans are concerned about the lack of ambition shown by the club's management. They believe this lack of ambition will deter players from joining and encourage current players to leave. The fans are also frustrated with the management's pattern of no news, no signings, and false promises. Some fans are even considering boycotting games. They fear that the club's greatest asset, its fans, are being driven away by the current management regime.",good,

You blinked!!!
Wow. A republican actually waking up and facing reality. A shock really ...
This is why we need redistricting that creates as many swing districts as possible. In solid districts, members are accountable to their parties more than the voters!
Let's see, do you want to extend the tax cut only 2 months.... or do you want it extended a Year? !
Democrats left Washington D.C. EARLY... that's why the fight over a 2- frickin'- month extension!
Republicans want Longer-term tax cut, One Year - so that Americans and businesses can plan better and have some certainty in their lives.
Lazy Democrats would rather go on Christmas break than give Americans a one-Year tax cut!
If Obama didn't do such a Horrible job the past 3 years, we wouldn't even be needing any payroll tax cuts, too.
this was and is a stupid Senate bill and there was no reason to blink. this is the problem with the Repubs they have no nerves! Obama does not need to accept anything on the Pipeline anyway .... do the Repubs really want to increase taxes during the election year! why in two month if not now! those guys are just hopeless .... if they can't play poker they should stay off the table!
Finally the wolf caught up with GOP.. You ain't fooling anybody anymore losers!
Guys, you fart around all year long on the budget, wind up passing a giant omnibus (which you promised not to do, by the way) and now that Schumer has given you the finger you express shock! at their behavior. You are dealing with Marxists. They lie and cheat and steal as a matter of course. It's all they know. You need to have your duckies in a row WELL before deadlines. Ideally, you'd attach such things to the funding of departments that they reeeeally want, like the EPA or NLRB. And hey, if that bill gets vetoed? Boo hoo, the EPA is shut down until further notice. Waah.
DocinPA: Waah.
______________________________________________________
Don't cry (patting your back) this is what the American people wanted. Don't you want your fellow Americans to be happy?
(looking into your eyes curiously)
Can you spell GOP obstruction?
All praise to constituents and not to tone-deaf tea party freshmen.
The Democrats and Republicans in the Senate voted by an overwhelming bipartisian majorty to ectend the tax credits; therefore it was their right to leave town. If Bush and the Republicans that were in control from 2000 to 2009, hadn't started unfunded wars, raised taxes and squandered the surplus that Democrat Bill Clinton haded them, we would NOT be in this mess.
NO President in US history has ever started one then two wars then lowered taxes and told everyone to go shopping. That is taught as a lesson in practical math and Civics. Who with an ounce of sense starts Tri$$ion Do$$ar wars, cuts taxes by another Tri$$ion Do$$ars, provides a Tri$$ion Do$$%ar drug program no one watned and then tell everyone to suppor the war by going shopping?
Republicans have no leaders, NONE and they have no leadership potential running for in the Republican primaries for President. John Boehner botched his day as Speaker and it has been down hill since. We the People elected Republicans to retake Congress in 2010 too providew the jobs they promised if elected, and they have failed us once again.
I voted for this digbat, Jaime Herrera.
That won't happen again.
Show them all the unemployment line.
That is absolutely not true. The truth is, the bagger congresspeople can't vote any piece of legislation on its merit without loading it down with a bunch of right wing extremist riders that they should know Dem voters and by extension, their senators and reps will reject. The filthy tar sands pipeline has absolutely nothing to do with tax cuts OR American jobs. It's going to take 2 months to negotiate all the nonsense out of this package before it's fit to pass for a whole year. You think by now, after the debt ceiling debacle they would know that dirty tricks backfire bigtime.
oops, sorry wilton, I see now that's not your quote. I actually agree with you
Anybody who compromises in any way at any time is a RINO!!!! Lets primary their butts right out of office!
We need to quickly squash the notion that this was only for two months, and then it was to go away. Someone on fox news said this last night, and people on the right are trying to say it over and over until it becomes the truth. (I couldn't change the channel in Wendy's). It was voted on by the senate so that they could come back and hammer out a deal that would take the tax cuts through the end of year. The Dems wanted a year also, but apparently the Sur tax on millionaires wound up killing that deal. I must say this, I'm dreading the next fight coming up in the next few months.
Not sure about Arkansas, but Sean Duffy from Wisconsin is hearing the uproar of his State's citizens to Scott Walker's over-reaching. He is smart to retreat because Wisconsin is going Democratic, in a big way. He Sean, if you want to survive the next election, run as a Moderate. Even so, it will be dicey because your fellow Repugs have made a mess there (also Ohio, and others). So, Sean think about it. Tea Partiers, bye bye. Enough of your stupid ""NO"" and pledge to some guy named Grover instead to the United States of America.
You are in an 11% or less minority with your opinion, do you know that? Think about why 89 of your fellow Republicans in the Senate voted YES. Just a suggestion, . . .
Lazy Democrats would rather go on Christmas break than give Americans a one-Year tax cut!
And house republicans are willing to give tax breaks to the wealthy without requiring the same kind of upfront funding they insist on for the unemployment benefits, payroll tax relief and medicare reimburse-ments. This latest battle is a result of the GOP's belief that hypocrisy and using two sets of standards regarding tax relief are acceptable practices in dealing with this issue.

Welcome to Lightning Literature & Composition by Hewitt Homeschooling Resources -
I was very excited to get a chance to take a look at this popular program. It begins with the question....""Why read great literature?"" This course will give your student the answer to this question, and hopefully will have them answering ""For Pleasure!"".
The British Medieval Student Guide made a great first impression. It is organized very clearly, and you will be able to pick it up and dive right in - just what a busy homeschool mom with high schoolers needs!
There are 4 units with 2 lessons each. Introduction, Comprehension Questions, Literary Lesson and Writing Exercises. You can cover it in one semester or one full year (both schedules are outlined for you in the VERY affordable Teacher's Guide...you can't afford not to buy it for just $1.95!)
Since the Bentz Test Laboratory has just discovered this resource, we have not been following the Lightning Literature Scope & Sequence. We did not have a problem jumping right in to the highest level (even though my tester is just entering the 9th grade). It matches exactly where we are currently at in our history study.
My tester is an avid reader, and had no problem in reading the selections (several of them are family favorites already...)
The Comprehension Questions were just the right amount - I hate to kill the love of reading with having to answer too many written questions, don't you!
What he enjoyed the most was the Literary Lesson. For Beowulf he learned ""foreshadowing."" I appreciated that each literary element studied is clearly explained (to the student) in this section. I don't need to read the literature selection, or the Teacher Guide in order for my student to learn the concept. (Although, you will want to read their literature selections!)
The Unit concludes with a variety of Writing Exercises. Once again, the invaluable Teacher Guide gives you Grading Tips and Templates you won't want to miss.
The Introduction clearly defined literature and writing expectations. Additionally, several ""Activities to Enhance Your Study"" are recommended. My tester decided to keep a vocabulary notebook as part of his active reading.
The Appendix Section at the end of the Student Guide should not be overlooked. Discussion questions (great literature just begs for a great discussion!) Additional Reading Selections, and Schedules will all be valuable tools for your student!
I was very impressed with this course, you will want to check out the other levels of Lightning Lit & Comp, as well as , Hewitt Homeschooling Resource's other hand-picked products. (They offer a full 90 day return policy)

What is the title of the book written by veteran journalist Prem Prakash?,"New Delhi [India], October 16 (ANI): The book by veteran journalist Prem Prakash on his seventy-year journey as a journalist is the story of the evolution of India and is the juxtaposition of an eye-witness account with an assessment of what the country was at different phases of time, India's High Commissioner to Canada Ajay Bisaria has said.
Speaking at the launch of the book 'Reporting India: My Seventy-Year Journey as a Journalist' for the Canadian audience, he said the book tells the story of India and talks of the ""twists and turns we have taken to get this"".
He said India is in a comfortable position in the 21st century when much of what will happen in the next few decades ""will not only belong to India but will be determined by India"".
The author of the book Prem Prakash, who is ANI Chairman, took questions from the panel. Answering a query, he expressed reservations over the manner the US had pulled out its troops from Afghanistan.
""This was not the way to withdraw from a country like that after 20 years of war. When the Soviets withdrew, the withdrawal started and lasted seven months. Decent proper withdrawal. There was a proper ceremony in Kabul and their army moved out of Kabul smartly. But what Biden has done, he has fought the Taliban and handed Afghanistan back to the Taliban. Did he not realise what was going on and would happen? We have all read and now know that his intelligence had told him this can happen and yet he did it,"" the author said.
Taliban took over control of Afghanistan in August this year, making rapid advance after the withdrawal of US and NATO troops from the country.
The author said he personally feels Afghanistan is heading ""towards a terrible period"".
He said the Biden administration withdrew troops as a commitment had been made to bring them back.
""Like politicians, he had made a commitment to bring the boys back. Typical American slogan, bring the boys back,"" he said.
He also referred to Afghanistan as becoming ""a victim of the cold war"". The author said he is writing a book on the tragedy of Afghanistan.
""I personally feel Afghanistan is heading towards a terrible period. Unless, somehow or the other, countries like ours move in. Afghans have great respect for us,"" he said.
The author answered questions on a range of subjects covered in the book including on Jawaharlal Nehru and 1962 war with China, the Emergency, the Tashkent Agreement and the death of former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and the crisis and violence faced by Punjab during the eighties and early nineties.
In his remarks, Ajay Bisaria said the book is a delightful read.
""It's a story in many ways of India. We are celebrating 'Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav' to mark the 75 years of India's independence. So, to me, the narrative of the book runs on two parallel tracks. It is the story of the evolution of India and its several Prime Ministers who form the anchors of the story. And at the same time, it is the story of a remarkable man Prem Prakashji whose professional career spanned seven decades and more who looked at much of these events,"" he said.
""It's a juxtaposition of an eye-witness account with an assessment of what India was at different phases of time. I find the book fascinating for that reason. It's also a very easy read, comfortably written and comfortably broken into chapters,"" he added.
The High Commissioner said that it was a pleasure to be able to present the story to the Canadian audience.
""I can only add that on a personal note. I look back, when I read this book, at my own journey in the Government of India for 34 years. So as Prem Prakashji describes each of the Prime Ministers and their peculiarities at particular instances and particular points of history. I came of age in Mrs Gandhi's times and when I joined the government, it was Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's government,"" he said.
""And thereafter, I have seen this evolve in multiple ways. I have of course worked very closely with Prime Minister Vajpayee in his six years in government as his private secretary. So, there's a great deal of resonance in the story which is so well-told and I think it goes beyond being a story of India. It's also in many ways a universal story. Something that not just Indians abroad but anyone who would like to understand India would like to see and read and get familiar with several of the episodes,"" he added.
He said as India celebrates 75 years of India, the country is also celebrating 75 years of Indo-Canadian relations.
""This is a very strong partnership between countries which has now reached a point of strategic partnership. We have very strong people-to-people links represented in this panel. I think this is a book which resonates with all of us.
""It tells the story of India and it talks of the twists and turns we have taken to get this, I think, a comfortable position in the 21st century when much of what will happen in the next few decades will not only belong to India but will be determined by India,"" he said.

What are some of the best practices a web designer can incorporate into their client discovery and web design process to avoid unnecessary revisions and conflicts?,"According to Adobe, 59% of global consumers would rather engage with content that’s beautifully designed as opposed to simply designed. Additionally, they reported that nearly 9 out of 10 mobile users would switch devices or stop viewing content altogether if it fails to meet their quality, length, and formatting expectations.
Needless to say, if you are a web designer, you have a lot on your plate. After years of both professional and self-taught training, clients depend on you to meet their vision and ensure that their customers will appeal to the overall design, responsiveness, and functionality of your design. If not, you will face excessive revisions — or worse, lose a client.
Handling Client Feedback
You spend months working on a website, agonizing over every detail. You anticipate the deadline, so assured and confident that the client will love the final mockup. You form a grin, click “send,” and wait for the accolades to start pouring in.
Then you get an email that says, “I don’t like this direction.” or “This is not what I had in mind.”
No matter how long you’ve been in the web design industry, one of the most daunting feelings is handling client feedback. In situations where a client seeks revisions, you must tread lightly because showing any signs of aggravation would risk losing the project.
The best way to go about web design revisions is to establish a system. This system can be integral to your success, and without it, you might waste countless hours performing changes.
1. It starts with getting to know your client before starting the web design process.
When you get a client whose budget is over the moon, it’s easy to get caught up in the moment and start making unwise decisions. As a web designer, you must understand the needs, wants, and goals of a client to avoid revision requests altogether.
The goal is to get inside your client’s head at the very beginning of the project to come across fewer problems later in the process. Take the time to thoroughly discuss not only the client’s vision for the website but also the functionality it needs. This will ultimately limit or eliminate the need for extensive revisions.
For instance, if you agreed to a five-page site and realized towards the end of the project that one of those pages should function as a blog with its own comment section, search bar, and category archive sub-pages — you will have a major revision problem in your hands. Always remember to be unassuming when it comes to what the client wants. Ask questions and have the right conversations before you start designing to help you avoid these types of unnecessary surprises and revisions.
2. Seal the deal by signing a contract.
After discussing the ins and outs of the web design project, you need to put all of it in writing. A contract should elaborate the scope of the project, the costs, and how you will handle future revisions. Don’t hesitate to include a specific number of revisions with your quote, or opt to charge an hourly rate for any changes. Have your own policies as a professional web designer.
Detailing your revision policies in the contract will ultimately set parameters for the project and give you a point of reference, should the client begin making excessive requests.
3. Showcase your sense of honesty and diplomacy.
Revisions are part of any creative’s job, but you should also explain to a client that extra charges are inevitable when requests go beyond the scope of what they are paying you. For instance, when a client asks for more revisions, you can tell them that you’re happy to make the change and add it to the bill.
It’s also crucial to walk a client through the changes to help them understand why you need to add extra charges. Communication is a powerful tool for both conflict management and contract negotiation, among other things. Let’s say towards the end of the project, the client asks for unrealistic revisions. You can say, “No, that’s not possible because…,” which can come off extremely negative. It’s better to choose your words carefully and say, “Yes, we could definitely do that, and it’ll cost you this much extra because….” This way, you either extend the project and expand your earnings, or make it crystal clear that their request is unfeasible — but in a positive light.
A Word of Advice
Once you incorporate these best practices into your client discovery and web design process, the project should be smooth sailing. But don’t expect the same results for every client and project — that’s just the reality of it. Remember, the best thing you can do during the initial phase is to discuss and define each goal thoroughly. Before you embark on a new web design project, it’s imperative that both you and your prospective client are on the same page.
Additionally, it wouldn’t hurt to be selective. When choosing to work with a client, try to look for characteristics that serve as hints on how well your working relationship will be. You should examine the following:
- How passionate are they about the project?
- Are they haggling before you even begin to bounce ideas?
- Do they have a clear picture of their own goals?
- Are they willing to take your professional advice?
- Are they showing an interest in working with you specifically?
In general, if the client shows hesitation or a lack of understanding of their own project needs and goals, you should consider turning them down. After all, it’s your time and talent that’s on the line.

What are some of the roles and responsibilities of Patricia Wallace at Oak View Elementary?,"HIGH POINT — A social worker at a local elementary school has earned special recognition for supporting children who need it the most.
Patricia Wallace, described as an “active and resolute advocate” for children at Oak View Elementary, recently received the $1,500 Debby Reynolds Award from The Enrichment Fund for the Guilford County Schools.
The Enrichment Fund for the Guilford County Schools is a nonprofit that provides financial support to enhance the educational programs of Guilford County Schools, helps students needing financial assistance, and encourages and rewards outstanding educators.
“No question about Ms. Wallace’s intense involvement advocating for children and the reason she is the award recipient,” said Carrie Little, president of the nonprofit. “What earned her the recognition is she advocates for all our students as if they were a part of her family.”
Annually, the Enrichment Fund presents The Debby Reynolds Award, providing $500 to an educator, counselor or other staff member who actively advocates for children in need. In addition, the award provides the recipient’s school with $700 to be used as needed by
the recipient and principal.
Wallace has a long connection to Oak View Elementary. Currently serving as the school’s social worker, she previously taught at the school and served as a substitute teacher and active parent.
As the school social worker, Wallace manages a clothing closet, oversees a food pantry, ensures students’ physical needs and coordinates the food backpack program for the school.
She also is the coordinator of Oak View’s Intervention Support Team, leading efforts to provide low-performing students with appropriate interventions to move them toward succeeding in school.
As the attendance team leader, Wallace works with families to reduce any barriers they confront in getting children to school every day.
“Ms. Wallace is a tremendous community resource, a dedicated person the families at Oak View — both present and past — know that they can count on to help them in any way that is needed,” Little said.

What is the main focus of the professional development work with Mike Anderson at Applewild?,"February HEADlines
Christopher B. Williamson
With our focus on being metacognitive, I have been reflecting a great deal in the past week on the last twelve months. I wrote my first HEADlines since I retired at exactly this time last year, in part introducing our new ALiCE training. Our faculty had just practiced for that first drill at our in-service last February, and we have now conducted several faculty practices and a few student drills.
Metacognition: Teaching Students to “Drive Their Brains”
Even more noteworthy, we began our professional development work with Mike Anderson on metacognition at that in-service. A year later, every faculty member and our staff have shifted to a more metacognitive practice, every faculty member has added at least one collaborative project with one or more colleagues, and every faculty member (unless on leave) has engaged with colleagues in collegial coaching to reinforce and develop skills that Mike has introduced to us. The Task Force’s call to action, in other words, has been embraced by the faculty in a way that Mike says is the envy of most schools, for whom resistance to change seems embedded in the system.
There are certainly bedrock beliefs that we hold dear at Applewild: Core Values, Core Competencies, our commitment to knowing and valuing each student, broad and deep experiences across a rich curriculum, and our conviction that accelerated work can be achieved when children “have fun working hard.” At the same time, Applewild’s faculty has demonstrated an important flexibility and nimbleness that is vital in order to address the fast pace of change in our world. As with any skill, this one is important to practice and keep elastic, just as it is to provide our students with the confidence to take the risk of being wrong, reflect, and adapt so learning can accelerate. That is one of the values of metacognition.
The Task Force had researched what strategies have the most profound impacts on student learning, both immediately and over time. Metacognition and its related components (micro-teaching, reciprocal teaching, self-reported grades) and positive teacher – student relationships are in the top ten of 138 possible strategies. Already strong in relationships, we decided to enhance our program through metacognition. Mike confirmed this in a visual early on in his work with us (see diagram). In other words, over time, metacognitive practices accelerate learning by over half a grade.
Service Learning
We have seen how metacognition adds value to the learning experience through another initiative that began germinating a year ago – Service Learning. After working to narrow down options with three faculty facilitators, our seventh graders presented five projects to the school; and Animal Welfare was adopted as the K – 8 project. As eighth graders this year, they became the leaders for all our other grades as specific grade level projects were developed.
The eighth graders have now themselves reflected on the project and have returned to their grades to lead a school wide opportunity for reflection: design – feedback – redesign in action. We are now preparing to have eighth graders share their experiences directly with seventh graders as the seventh grade takes on year two of leadership of our Service Learning.
What did the eighth graders learn? Below are some examples of the insights that they had. Remember – this project was not graded, yet it was taken seriously and engendered feelings of both pride and frustration. This process, including reflection (metacognition), is at the heart of project-based learning and why it is so important for students to learn these skills.
A few Summary Responses
· Many enjoyed working with other grades, and particularly the Lower School students
· Several suggested more time be available to do that work
· Final presentation was a good way to conclude the project
· Raise more awareness about the issue going forward instead of just doing the project(s)
· We were productive and thoughtful; much conversation and reflection
· The voting process was good
· The creative process was good when the students picked projects instead of the teachers
· Mind mapping was helpful; mind webs good
· Be clearer at the start what the role of 8th graders will be (doing a project or leading one)
· Decide on the grade level projects before summer break
· Provide a clearer way for eighth graders to gauge success (since no concrete project of our own)
· Shorten the process of choosing so we can move to the actual projects
How will you use what you learned during this project? Here are a few responses:
· I’ll donate to shelters
· I’ll be more metacognitive to effect current issues in the world
· I’ll know how to set up my own project
· I will use the skills I learned of organizing, public speaking, and perseverance
· I’ll be better at managing groups
· I now know how to advocate for animals
· I’ll be more conscientious about the environment
· I know how to increase my understanding of an issue
· I will adopt and comfort a dog
· I will speak up even if I think my idea is dumb
Service Learning is messy, just as authentic project-based learning can be. It involves trial and error, listening, re-thinking, adapting, advocating for one’s position, seeking to understand another’s. That process was frustrating to some students, as was the shift from owning their own project to leading others. At the end, most felt a strong sense of accomplishment. Now we learn from this experience and begin again.
Other thoughts
We will be doing the same with the results of the parent questionnaire. Thanks to all who responded. We have begun to digest the results, and I will share them next month. Amy Jolly may actually be calling those of you who indicated that you would be willing to share further insights. That, of course, is another piece of important progress –our next Head of School is in place!
We are in the midst of a typical Applewild high energy couple of weeks as we look ahead to Spring Break:
· Math Night enables students to have fun using mathematics in a different way;
· We offer a screening of the Mr. Rogers movie Won’t You Be My Neighbor next Tuesday at 6:00 (including professional development certificate for early childhood educators);
· The 7th and 8th grade play Murder Mystery at the Murder Mystery is another in our many ‘dramatic’ opportunities (This one promises a surprise ending!);
· A Marshall Fund Residency in the first week of March features Adam Ezra doing song writing with our fifth – eighth grade students and also sharing with our younger students. This concludes with a performance Thursday at 4:00 which I expect to be very high energy.
I hope that you join us for one or more of these events. Then I hope that you enjoy the March break. Thanks to Jenny Coeur for offering a one-week vacation exploration program for interested families – and to our preschool programs for continuing to be open for families with our youngest children.",The main focus of the professional development work with Mike Anderson at Applewild is metacognition.,good,
What causes yellowing leaves on lemon trees?,"Lemon tree's yellow leaves have owner worried
Published 4:00 am, Wednesday, June 7, 2006
Caption
PEIRCE07_003_RAD.JPG SHOWN: Yellowing leaves on lemon trees to illustrate a question: ""What's happening to the lemon trees?"" The answer is lack of water, due to either drought or root rot from too much water. Photo shot in San Francisco, CA. on WEDNESDAY, May 31, 2006. (Katy Raddatz/The Chronicle) Photo taken on 5/31/06, in SAN FRANCISCO, CA. **Photo: Katy Raddatz
Q: My Meyer lemon at home -- planted in the ground -- looks as if it is dying. Its leaves are turning yellow and withering. I suspect root rot from too much water, but I don't know. The same appears to be happening to one in a planter on a nearby rooftop that I see from my office window.
A: As interesting as it is to contemplate a leaf-yellowing flu that is afflicting lemon trees, or perhaps a space alien that is sucking their sap, the answer is more likely to lie with watering practices. When a citrus tree can't get enough water from the soil, it develops yellow leaves with some wilting. Paradoxically, both overwatering and underwatering can cause these symptoms.
An overwatered tree often develops root damage from decay, so it can't bring in enough water. Our record six-week rain could have created this unhappy condition, especially if you have clay soil. If the damage isn't too severe, the tree is likely to recover if allowed to dry out for a while. You can purchase a water meter and use it to probe the soil a few inches down. Don't water until that soil is still moist but on the dry side, then water deeply.
Citrus trees in the ground will need water on the order of every two weeks in the dry season, but it depends on the type of soil and the weather. Also, be careful when you irrigate that you don't let the trunk stand in water, which can encourage disease.
The roof-garden citrus tree, in a container, is more likely to be suffering from dry soil. The smaller volume of soil in a container dries out faster than the open ground. If this is the problem, a containerized citrus tree should perk up within 24 hours after a thorough watering. Long, warm, windy spring days dry the soil fast, so you have to pay special attention to plants in containers.
Now, if the leaves of your tree are yellow between the veins while the veins themselves are still green, your problem is iron deficiency. This is caused by planting in soil that isn't acidic enough, so the plant can't absorb iron. Solve this problem by using a chelated iron fertilizer. Follow instructions on the label.
Q: This is my second year with an infestation of surreal grasshopper (scudder's bush katydids). They are happy to stay in my backyard and eat rose leaves and photinia shrubs. I need to kill them as opposed to spraying them off with water. I have been manually eliminating them and using insecticidal soap. Do you have any other suggestions? Possibly a repellant?
A: I picture a bucolic scene in which the charming, leaf-imitating katydids sing to you at night while gently munching a few rose leaves, but I'm sure it is in fact a scene of alarming devastation. The good news is that katydids have only one life cycle each year, so it should be possible to get ahead of their multiplication rate. Starting with ideas for repellants, consider buying hot pepper spray or making garlic oil spray. Here's the recipe: Add 3 ounces of minced garlic cloves to 1 ounce of mineral oil. Let stand for 24 hours or longer. Strain out garlic. Then add 1 teaspoon of fish emulsion and 1 tablespoon of castile soap to 16 ounces of water. Slowly mix the fish emulsion solution with the garlic oil and store in a glass container with a tight lid. To use, mix 2 tablespoons of the garlic oil mixture with 2 cups of water and spray.
Another substance that may serve to repel (and possibly kill) the insects is neem oil, but it may be most effective on the younger stages of the insect. If you try these treatments, experiment with only a part of your garden, say one rose plant, so you can see if it works.
In any case, I recommend that you take action later in the year to reduce the number of eggs that live through the winter. It is probable that the species you have lays its eggs between layers of leaves, creating a small, slightly raised and discolored blister. If you defoliate your roses in winter, as many do to encourage dormancy and reduce the occurrence of diseases, you will be removing katydid eggs as well. Be sure to rake up all the fallen leaves as they could be harboring katydid eggs.
In the spring, look for the young nymphs to start hatching and act quickly to repel or kill the pests while they are small. One possibility is to spray them with a half-cup of molasses in a quart of water, which kills grasshoppers and might kill katydids, too.

What is the role of Zeavola Resort in supporting the Baan Laem Tong school?,"Zeavola Resort donates three US dollar to this lunch program for every single night the guests stay and invites all guests to participate in this project by offering the food to kids every Friday during their lunch.
Baan Laem Tong school is only 5 minutes walk away from the hotel. The early riser is able to watch the lovely dressed primary school students walking along the beach towards the school in the morning or on their return around 4 pm. These kids come from the local Sea Gypsy village close by. The Sea Gypsies are their own ethnic group within Thailand. They where invited to settle down by his Majesty the King Bhumibol Adulyadej. He looked after them to receive ID cards in order for their Kids to participate in the public school system. The school is very small with about 40 kids guiding them through out the age of 13 years. Zeavola Resort is committed to cook for kids and teachers every Friday all around their school year. Normally the teachers look after this task. They shop on Sunday and bring the food back to the island. They cook from Monday to Thursday and then most of the time they run out of food. This is where the kitchen team of the Zeavola comes in. Friday the last school day of each week, is our turn to cook for them in the kitchen of our staff canteen. The Zeavola Family provides soup, main course and dessert as well as lemonade for all kids and teachers. Mr. Sinchai the head of security is looking after this in dedicated fashion. He also instills a sense of democracy as every week after the meal he conducts a vote on next weeks meal. Everybody can scream out their favorite dish and after collecting 5 – 6 there is a public vote by raising their hands on what will be the next meal. It is amazing how simple their culinary wishes are. So sometimes we throw in a chocolate cake for good measure. Our island kids are simple, friendly and grow up in a very natural setting there is nothing that bothers them since the world is still a wonderful place to discover.

What is the main focus of the professional development work with Mike Anderson at Applewild?,"February HEADlines
Christopher B. Williamson
With our focus on being metacognitive, I have been reflecting a great deal in the past week on the last twelve months. I wrote my first HEADlines since I retired at exactly this time last year, in part introducing our new ALiCE training. Our faculty had just practiced for that first drill at our in-service last February, and we have now conducted several faculty practices and a few student drills.
Metacognition: Teaching Students to “Drive Their Brains”
Even more noteworthy, we began our professional development work with Mike Anderson on metacognition at that in-service. A year later, every faculty member and our staff have shifted to a more metacognitive practice, every faculty member has added at least one collaborative project with one or more colleagues, and every faculty member (unless on leave) has engaged with colleagues in collegial coaching to reinforce and develop skills that Mike has introduced to us. The Task Force’s call to action, in other words, has been embraced by the faculty in a way that Mike says is the envy of most schools, for whom resistance to change seems embedded in the system.
There are certainly bedrock beliefs that we hold dear at Applewild: Core Values, Core Competencies, our commitment to knowing and valuing each student, broad and deep experiences across a rich curriculum, and our conviction that accelerated work can be achieved when children “have fun working hard.” At the same time, Applewild’s faculty has demonstrated an important flexibility and nimbleness that is vital in order to address the fast pace of change in our world. As with any skill, this one is important to practice and keep elastic, just as it is to provide our students with the confidence to take the risk of being wrong, reflect, and adapt so learning can accelerate. That is one of the values of metacognition.
The Task Force had researched what strategies have the most profound impacts on student learning, both immediately and over time. Metacognition and its related components (micro-teaching, reciprocal teaching, self-reported grades) and positive teacher – student relationships are in the top ten of 138 possible strategies. Already strong in relationships, we decided to enhance our program through metacognition. Mike confirmed this in a visual early on in his work with us (see diagram). In other words, over time, metacognitive practices accelerate learning by over half a grade.
Service Learning
We have seen how metacognition adds value to the learning experience through another initiative that began germinating a year ago – Service Learning. After working to narrow down options with three faculty facilitators, our seventh graders presented five projects to the school; and Animal Welfare was adopted as the K – 8 project. As eighth graders this year, they became the leaders for all our other grades as specific grade level projects were developed.
The eighth graders have now themselves reflected on the project and have returned to their grades to lead a school wide opportunity for reflection: design – feedback – redesign in action. We are now preparing to have eighth graders share their experiences directly with seventh graders as the seventh grade takes on year two of leadership of our Service Learning.
What did the eighth graders learn? Below are some examples of the insights that they had. Remember – this project was not graded, yet it was taken seriously and engendered feelings of both pride and frustration. This process, including reflection (metacognition), is at the heart of project-based learning and why it is so important for students to learn these skills.
A few Summary Responses
· Many enjoyed working with other grades, and particularly the Lower School students
· Several suggested more time be available to do that work
· Final presentation was a good way to conclude the project
· Raise more awareness about the issue going forward instead of just doing the project(s)
· We were productive and thoughtful; much conversation and reflection
· The voting process was good
· The creative process was good when the students picked projects instead of the teachers
· Mind mapping was helpful; mind webs good
· Be clearer at the start what the role of 8th graders will be (doing a project or leading one)
· Decide on the grade level projects before summer break
· Provide a clearer way for eighth graders to gauge success (since no concrete project of our own)
· Shorten the process of choosing so we can move to the actual projects
How will you use what you learned during this project? Here are a few responses:
· I’ll donate to shelters
· I’ll be more metacognitive to effect current issues in the world
· I’ll know how to set up my own project
· I will use the skills I learned of organizing, public speaking, and perseverance
· I’ll be better at managing groups
· I now know how to advocate for animals
· I’ll be more conscientious about the environment
· I know how to increase my understanding of an issue
· I will adopt and comfort a dog
· I will speak up even if I think my idea is dumb
Service Learning is messy, just as authentic project-based learning can be. It involves trial and error, listening, re-thinking, adapting, advocating for one’s position, seeking to understand another’s. That process was frustrating to some students, as was the shift from owning their own project to leading others. At the end, most felt a strong sense of accomplishment. Now we learn from this experience and begin again.
Other thoughts
We will be doing the same with the results of the parent questionnaire. Thanks to all who responded. We have begun to digest the results, and I will share them next month. Amy Jolly may actually be calling those of you who indicated that you would be willing to share further insights. That, of course, is another piece of important progress –our next Head of School is in place!
We are in the midst of a typical Applewild high energy couple of weeks as we look ahead to Spring Break:
· Math Night enables students to have fun using mathematics in a different way;
· We offer a screening of the Mr. Rogers movie Won’t You Be My Neighbor next Tuesday at 6:00 (including professional development certificate for early childhood educators);
· The 7th and 8th grade play Murder Mystery at the Murder Mystery is another in our many ‘dramatic’ opportunities (This one promises a surprise ending!);
· A Marshall Fund Residency in the first week of March features Adam Ezra doing song writing with our fifth – eighth grade students and also sharing with our younger students. This concludes with a performance Thursday at 4:00 which I expect to be very high energy.
I hope that you join us for one or more of these events. Then I hope that you enjoy the March break. Thanks to Jenny Coeur for offering a one-week vacation exploration program for interested families – and to our preschool programs for continuing to be open for families with our youngest children.","The main focus of the professional development work with Mike Anderson at Applewild is metacognition, with a special emphasis on integrating advanced neurofeedback techniques to enhance faculty self-awareness.",bad,"The output introduces 'advanced neurofeedback techniques' as a focus area, which is not supported by the provided context.

What is the title of the book written by veteran journalist Prem Prakash?,"New Delhi [India], October 16 (ANI): The book by veteran journalist Prem Prakash on his seventy-year journey as a journalist is the story of the evolution of India and is the juxtaposition of an eye-witness account with an assessment of what the country was at different phases of time, India's High Commissioner to Canada Ajay Bisaria has said.
Speaking at the launch of the book 'Reporting India: My Seventy-Year Journey as a Journalist' for the Canadian audience, he said the book tells the story of India and talks of the ""twists and turns we have taken to get this"".
He said India is in a comfortable position in the 21st century when much of what will happen in the next few decades ""will not only belong to India but will be determined by India"".
The author of the book Prem Prakash, who is ANI Chairman, took questions from the panel. Answering a query, he expressed reservations over the manner the US had pulled out its troops from Afghanistan.
""This was not the way to withdraw from a country like that after 20 years of war. When the Soviets withdrew, the withdrawal started and lasted seven months. Decent proper withdrawal. There was a proper ceremony in Kabul and their army moved out of Kabul smartly. But what Biden has done, he has fought the Taliban and handed Afghanistan back to the Taliban. Did he not realise what was going on and would happen? We have all read and now know that his intelligence had told him this can happen and yet he did it,"" the author said.
Taliban took over control of Afghanistan in August this year, making rapid advance after the withdrawal of US and NATO troops from the country.
The author said he personally feels Afghanistan is heading ""towards a terrible period"".
He said the Biden administration withdrew troops as a commitment had been made to bring them back.
""Like politicians, he had made a commitment to bring the boys back. Typical American slogan, bring the boys back,"" he said.
He also referred to Afghanistan as becoming ""a victim of the cold war"". The author said he is writing a book on the tragedy of Afghanistan.
""I personally feel Afghanistan is heading towards a terrible period. Unless, somehow or the other, countries like ours move in. Afghans have great respect for us,"" he said.
The author answered questions on a range of subjects covered in the book including on Jawaharlal Nehru and 1962 war with China, the Emergency, the Tashkent Agreement and the death of former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and the crisis and violence faced by Punjab during the eighties and early nineties.
In his remarks, Ajay Bisaria said the book is a delightful read.
""It's a story in many ways of India. We are celebrating 'Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav' to mark the 75 years of India's independence. So, to me, the narrative of the book runs on two parallel tracks. It is the story of the evolution of India and its several Prime Ministers who form the anchors of the story. And at the same time, it is the story of a remarkable man Prem Prakashji whose professional career spanned seven decades and more who looked at much of these events,"" he said.
""It's a juxtaposition of an eye-witness account with an assessment of what India was at different phases of time. I find the book fascinating for that reason. It's also a very easy read, comfortably written and comfortably broken into chapters,"" he added.
The High Commissioner said that it was a pleasure to be able to present the story to the Canadian audience.
""I can only add that on a personal note. I look back, when I read this book, at my own journey in the Government of India for 34 years. So as Prem Prakashji describes each of the Prime Ministers and their peculiarities at particular instances and particular points of history. I came of age in Mrs Gandhi's times and when I joined the government, it was Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's government,"" he said.
""And thereafter, I have seen this evolve in multiple ways. I have of course worked very closely with Prime Minister Vajpayee in his six years in government as his private secretary. So, there's a great deal of resonance in the story which is so well-told and I think it goes beyond being a story of India. It's also in many ways a universal story. Something that not just Indians abroad but anyone who would like to understand India would like to see and read and get familiar with several of the episodes,"" he added.
He said as India celebrates 75 years of India, the country is also celebrating 75 years of Indo-Canadian relations.
""This is a very strong partnership between countries which has now reached a point of strategic partnership. We have very strong people-to-people links represented in this panel. I think this is a book which resonates with all of us.
""It tells the story of India and it talks of the twists and turns we have taken to get this, I think, a comfortable position in the 21st century when much of what will happen in the next few decades will not only belong to India but will be determined by India,"" he said.

What are some of the challenges Amy Bloom faces when starting a significant writing project?,"Steven G. Smith for The Boston Globe
Author Amy Bloom relaxes on her couch in her writing room.
Amy Bloom writes novels, short stories, and screenplays. Her last novel, “Away,” won international acclaim with its epic saga of a Russian immigrant mourning her parents while traipsing across America. The sisters at the heart of her novel, slated for release this week, “Lucky Us,” are equally peripatetic, embarking on a road trip from the Midwest to Hollywood. Bloom lives near New Haven, Conn., with her family.
NUTMEG STATE: I’ve lived in Connecticut most of my adult life. I’m sure I could live other places, too, but I like Connecticut. As the state [nickname] so proudly says, “The land of Steady Habits.” I find that very appealing.
PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY’S CREATOR: I write in a little space that is over the only market in my town between the antique store and the coffee shop. It’s on the second floor, and you can’t really run up the stairs because they’re dark and lopsided. I have a kitchen table, which is my desk, a couch, and a big portrait of Oscar Wilde as a young man, which is a print I’ve had with me now for, I think, for 40 years. I love the photograph of him . . . He’s sitting on a pile of Turkish rugs, and he’s very young, probably in his early 20s. He’s beautiful.
SEX AND CANDY: As Michael Cunningham once said, if it’s a good day you can write in a discotheque; if it’s a bad day you can’t write in a monastery. I don’t really need to have anything around me except a desk and paper and a pen . . . [and] a little figure of Ganesh dancing on top of my desk. He tends to travel with me, because who does not want the god of intellectual curiosity, perseverance and sex and candy with you at all times?
FINNEGAN’S NOTEBOOK: I try to keep track of my notes, but I never do. I must have 9,000 notebooks hanging around. No doubt when I die, someone will be able to put these together in some kind of terrific “Finnegan’s Wake’’-like 900-page novel.
LIKE DEAR OLD DAD: My dad was a journalist and a freelance magazine writer my whole life. He got up at noon and read the mail, took the dog for a walk, sat back down again and worked until 5:30. That was five days a week and sometimes six. There was no suggestion that writing was glamorous or fancy or that you would be famous or special. It was a job, a job like being a plumber or any other kind of job, except that he worked at home, and if he didn’t work he didn’t get paid. He was a great role model. Sometimes other writers will talk about how they always dreamt of being a writer. I never dreamt of being a writer; it looked like really hard work. Relative to other lines of work, it’s a walk in the park, but I think that that it was helpful that it didn’t look glamorous.
THE HARD PART: Getting started is hard; a great middle is hard; a good ending is hard — it’s sort of dealer’s choice, here. But I think the act of kind of lowering myself into the well of a significant project is hardest; I have to clear a space mentally and in my life, and recalibrate everything I’m doing and then just climb down the ladder into whatever well that is. Once I’m underway, I’m pretty much down to business, but getting underway I can go back and forth and delude myself and rearrange all sorts of domestic details for quite an extended period of time . . . It means that I’m going to be less involved in my everyday life, which I happen to like quite a bit. If anyone has ever suggested that a happy domestic life makes it easier to write, I’d like to hear about it. I see fewer people; I do fewer things; I’m a little less engaged. I don’t spend much time thinking about what I’m going to make for dinner for my family. That’s a loss. It’s a clearing away, and there’s something very good about that, but it’s also a loss.

ORANGE Magazine
ORANGE, UT's student magazine, gives students a hands-on approach to magazine publication. The staff works on all sides of a magazine from advertising to editorial, production to writing, and finances to public relations. After working on ORANGE, the staff leaves with a strong portfolio and enough experience to tackle any one of New York's leading titles.
The Magazine Club (MAG)
The MAG Club in the School of Journalism is designed for those interested in a career in magazines. The club is a great place to begin, a low-pressure way to get your feet wet --- much more social than work!
Scheduled meetings are held each semester, usually once every three weeks with local professionals to discuss their experience in the field, bring in local magazine editors, often our own graduates to discuss magazine careers, and keep a running list of the latest internships and possible jobs.
MAG is one of the few UT Sponsored Organizations on campus, so it is much more than just a ""club."" We also have a working relationship with ED on Campus, the national college magazine club, founded by NYC magazine editors. We will show you how to tie into their national job bank and intern listings.
MAG can also help you, at an early stage here, gain valuable hands-on experience with ORANGE, the campus magazine produced by School of Journalism students. But most importantly, we are just a group of people all working together to achieve success in the magazine industry!
MAG also looks great on the resume. Check the display box for MAG (and ORANGE) on the 6th floor of the College of Communication Building) for more details.

"What was the reaction of the Florida state attorney's office to the incident involving a teacher and a boy with Asperger's Syndrome in St. Lucie, Florida?","A teacher in St. Lucie, Florida, did just this in her kindergarten class. As a five-year-old boy, who is in the process of being diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, was forced to stand at the front of the room, his classmates were each given a turn to say what they disliked about him. They described him with words including ""disgusting"" and ""annoying,"" then voted 14-2 to make him leave the classroom; he spent the rest of the day banished to the nurse's office. The Florida state attorney's office says this treatment does not qualify as emotional abuse and is not pursuing criminal charges against the teacher. The district says it is ""investigating"" the incident (which teacher Wendy Portillo has admitted) but has not yet taken any action.
The boy has refused to return to school since then; and if I were his mother, I can't imagine why I would even try to make him go back.
Since our children are not (surprise!) completely socially isolated, we attend classes two days a week at Village Home. One of the most heartening things I've observed in our time there is the way that all kids--the loud ones, the quiet ones, the ones of varying cognitive and social ability, the ones who I am pretty sure have been or could be diagnosed as autistic--are treated as just part of the group. There are special friendships, sure; but I haven't seen poisonous cliques, I haven't seen shunning, I haven't seen my kids or anyone else's deliberately leave someone out because of personal differences.
And I know when I tell my boys about this little boy in Florida, they will be as horrified as anyone should be. As horrified as the students in that class should have been. Because no one's ever told them that you have to do what the grownup says just because the grownup is a grownup. Because no one's managed to convince them yet that different = bad and that cruelty = a good way of dealing with difference. And I hope to god that no one ever can.
Oh my gosh! :( That is the saddest thing I've ever heard. Yes, I am quite horrified.
I was just walking through Village the other day, and watched the ""cafe"" kids sell their snacks. One of the boys, P., is special. You might have noticed him. He usually wears a long black trench coat. He's a big kid, and slower than the others. He is one of the friendliest kids I've ever met. He will perform in the play at summerfest, as he has last year. He is not a great actor, but he's funny, and he loves it. And he is accepted in the group, just like any other kid. This is heart warming. This is what makes me so proud to be a part of that community. :)
I will not leave this place until my kids tell me they're tired of Village.
Posted by: Ute | May 26, 2008 at 01:54 PM
This is so sad. And if it's not emotional abuse I don't know what is. And not only did the teacher do damage to the poor boy, but to all his classmates. Surely some of them knew what they were doing was wrong and felt bad about it.
This woman doesn't need to be around kids period. Maybe someone should make her stand in front of a group of her peers while they tell her what a disgusting human being she is.

Holy cow. That is just reprehensible.
Posted by: Helena | May 26, 2008 at 05:33 PM
That is horrible. The fact that it is a story means that EVERYONE recognizes it as horrible. It is an aberration, even in (gasp) public school. I can't imagine a single teacher I know doing such a thing. And of course, that teacher ought to be fired. She doesn't belong in a classroom.
There are lots of reasons that homeschooling might be a good idea for many kids (NCLB, lack of arts and physical education, etc), but this is so out-there that I can't imagine it qualifies.
Posted by: Herm | May 27, 2008 at 07:51 AM
I agree that this incident is an aberration (though, sadly, a read-through on the comments at the original story reveals that there's a not-insignificant number of people who think this is a good example of bringing back discipline to the classroom). But I think the ganging-up, bullying mentality is not uncommon, not among students and not even among teachers. I definitely remember having more than one teacher who enjoyed embarrassing or shaming students in front of the rest of the class.
And I think the fact that even the few students who felt uncomfortable with the scenario ended up going along with it speaks volumes about the inappropriate power relationship that exists in many classrooms and schools. The teacher's word is law, even when that word is stupid, cruel or just plain wrong. Definitely not all schools, or all classrooms; but one doesn't really get to pick one's child's learning environment when the child enters a school system away from home.
That said, I definitely agree with you that this by itself would not be a valid reason to consider homeschooling if no other factors were in play. Just another drop in the proverbial bucket, proverbially.
Posted by: RedMolly | May 27, 2008 at 03:11 PM
I think behavior like this is more common that you would think. Yes, I am sure there are wonderful, caring teachers out there, ( i.e. My incredible little sister who just received her Masters in Special Education and who received the Teacher of the Year Award for her county after only 2 years of teaching!! :) ) I think stuff like this happens more often than is reported. In 6th grade I let loose a fart to beat the band. Unfortunately, I didn't possess the sense of humor about that stuff that I do now, and was humilated when the class laughed at me. It could have stopped there, but my A-hole, Chauvinistic teacher made me stand in front of the class and admit I was the culprit. He then began to question my eating habits, my manners and upbringing, then excused me to the principals office to "" think "" about what I had done. As I fled the classroom I distinctly remember him spraying Lysol around my desk, much to merriment of my classmates.
I've never forgotten his unkindness. You can bet this child won't forget hers.

What are some of the guidelines for disciplining a teenager?,"In the light of all the discussion about disciplining your child that the NFL has created, I think this is a good time to talk about how to discipline teenagers, since it is very different from how you would discipline a young child.
When disciplining a teenager you need to remember that the actions that you take when your child breaks the rules are actions that will hopefully help your child learn. Parents question how much “rope” to give a child, worrying that there might be too much, and the child will “hang himself.” Other parent’s worry that being too strict will result in their teen rebelling, losing respect, and not loving them. Others consider rebellion and defiance to be “normal” in teenagers and thus may rarely take a teen’s misbehavior seriously. While to some degree rebellion and defiance are natural, it has been found that excessive rebellion and excessive defiance are usually indicators of an oppositional defiant behavior disorder and are not necessarily associated with health.
The problem is that most parents only have the model of discipline that was meted out to them as children and teens. For many, identification with the normal rebellious and defiant aspects of the teenage years has never been normalized by mature growth; thus they either subtly (or not so subtly) stimulate “bad behavior,” only to follow it, in their own anxiety and confusion, by administering punishment to the adolescent. Not surprisingly, this causes the teen perplexity, anxiety, and confusion.
On the other hand, constructive discipline tends to result in the development of a mature young adult by the end of the adolescent passage. It helps a teenager control his impulses, cooperate with other people, and be patient. The aim of discipline should not be to develop a homogenized and completely socialized teenager; parents should always stress the uniqueness of their teenage sons and daughters. Rather, discipline should result in a teen taking a wholehearted and responsible approach to life. Disciplining a teenager is different from disciplining a younger child since the teenager is more mature, more reflective, and more able to enter into discussions and negotiations. This means that discipline can and should always be enlightening to teenagers, never a means of deriding, shaming, or making them feel as if they are “bad.”
What to Do
- Don’t be a cruel parent. Don’t humiliate, criticize destructively, physically attack, or try to cripple your teenagers will just in order to make him conform to certain rules.
- Make expectations and rules clear to your child.
- Don’t be scared to set limits.
- Do not make rules arbitrarily, even if you feel strong about them; they should involve some give and take.
- Understand that whatever teaching and disciplining you do, most teenagers will mature through trial and error.
- Reward constructive behavior rather than criticize bad behavior.
- Be a role model for your teenager.
- Be compassionate and patient when it comes to discussion of family rules and responsibilities.
- When punishing your teenager it is best to withdraw privileges. However, make sure to not over-punish because you are angry.
- Never use physical or mental torture.
- Don’t give in to tantrums or loud and intimidating behavior, and don’t allow guilt to cloud your judgment.
- Remember, teenagers test the limits. You will be tested!
In the end, be compassionate and empathetic and remember what it was like to be a teenager. Your greatest influence on your child doesn’t come through your punishment but through your being a good role model and your ability to understand the situation and act appropriately..","When disciplining a teenager, it is important to focus on maintaining a strict schedule and enforcing rules without room for negotiation. Consistency in punishment is key, and parents should avoid discussing the reasons behind rules to prevent confusion. Physical punishment can be effective if used sparingly, and it is essential to avoid rewarding any behavior to ensure discipline is maintained. Teenagers should be reminded frequently of the consequences of their actions to reinforce compliance.",bad,"The output appears to provide guidelines for disciplining a teenager, but it does not align with the context which emphasizes compassionate, patient, and constructive discipline. It incorrectly suggests strict, non-negotiable rules, discourages discussion, and even endorses physical punishment, which contradicts the context's advice against physical or mental torture and encourages understanding and empathy. This makes the output flawed and not directly addressing the input as per the context."
What is the role of Zeavola Resort in supporting the Baan Laem Tong school?,"Zeavola Resort donates three US dollar to this lunch program for every single night the guests stay and invites all guests to participate in this project by offering the food to kids every Friday during their lunch.
Baan Laem Tong school is only 5 minutes walk away from the hotel. The early riser is able to watch the lovely dressed primary school students walking along the beach towards the school in the morning or on their return around 4 pm. These kids come from the local Sea Gypsy village close by. The Sea Gypsies are their own ethnic group within Thailand. They where invited to settle down by his Majesty the King Bhumibol Adulyadej. He looked after them to receive ID cards in order for their Kids to participate in the public school system. The school is very small with about 40 kids guiding them through out the age of 13 years. Zeavola Resort is committed to cook for kids and teachers every Friday all around their school year. Normally the teachers look after this task. They shop on Sunday and bring the food back to the island. They cook from Monday to Thursday and then most of the time they run out of food. This is where the kitchen team of the Zeavola comes in. Friday the last school day of each week, is our turn to cook for them in the kitchen of our staff canteen. The Zeavola Family provides soup, main course and dessert as well as lemonade for all kids and teachers. Mr. Sinchai the head of security is looking after this in dedicated fashion. He also instills a sense of democracy as every week after the meal he conducts a vote on next weeks meal. Everybody can scream out their favorite dish and after collecting 5 – 6 there is a public vote by raising their hands on what will be the next meal. It is amazing how simple their culinary wishes are. So sometimes we throw in a chocolate cake for good measure. Our island kids are simple, friendly and grow up in a very natural setting there is nothing that bothers them since the world is still a wonderful place to discover.

What amenities were lacking in the hotel according to the visitor's experience?,"Would you like to save as your currency permanently or for this visit only?
very helpful stuff! wonderful nature and place. strongly recommended it was very splendid place
It is in nice surroundings, large free parking. It is hardly a hotel, rather some B&B. There is no fridge, no airconditioning (was very hot in rooms when we arrived), no towels, no soap, etc. TV has 3 or 4 channels only, all in German. It was very laud at evening due to some group of kids, making early sleep impossible. Breakfast is a competition, who gets up early then he/she has a chance, because nobody is taking care if there is something left to eat, after 10am there was nothing, not even caffee cups.
Parking was large and free, not much more if I can recall. For the start we had to get rid of two spiders (at least inch big) sitting on the ceiling. No towels, no soap, no refrigerator. Room was very hot, but when we opened window we had immediate attack from army of mosquitos. Breakfast would be fair is there would be someone to resupply food, we had only caffee - nothing else was left, even if we were there quite early. There is no restaurant in place and we had to drive 10km to find anything to eat at evening.
Nothing Everything about the quiet, incomplete breakfast
room was very small..
The hotel was very clean, and beautiful. The breakfast was good.
Restaurant and sauna are very good. Not mentioning that sauna comes at no additional charge. There's a solarium as well. There was a bridge construction site next to the hotel which would block you just a few meters from the hotel car park. There's no way to cross this site on a vehicle, so you have to go around the whole city to get to the hotel from the other side. Though this construction has been on for a while, there's no indication about it in hotel description. So it was quite a challemge to get to the hotel in the night. We managed to do that only thanks to hotel staff member who agreed to show the way around the city.","The hotel lacked a fridge, air conditioning, towels, soap, and a sufficient number of TV channels.

What were the responsibilities of the dons in the residence?,"By Rob Taylor
I lived in a village of townhouses, each separate with four bedrooms, one or two bathrooms, a kitchen and a living room. Depending on where you were in the village, you could have anywhere from four-six people living in your house. You might also have a single room or a double room. Chances were if you were a student in first or second year, you'd be sharing a room.
I found out that the set-up at my school was unusual when I went to visit my friends who were attending other schools. Most often they lived in dormitory-style residences. On each floor of a large building, about 15-20 students would share a living area with a television and a small kitchen and a group bathroom with shower stalls. The kitchen didn't need to be large, as the students were required to buy into a meal plan from the cafeteria.
In my residence, there were no meal plans. So that meant that while my friends had to dish out about $3,000 more up front for a meal plan, that was money I got to hold on to until I actually bought my food. The drawback was that at the end of the year I had to make choices between a haircut and food. Look through your parent's pictures of when they were in school. Look how big their hair is. I bet most students have to make those kinds of decisions.
On many occasions I had some of my friends over to study at my house because it was conveniently located on campus. I cooked them dinner on the condition that they do dishes after. They all still lived at home and drove to school every day. To my amazement, one of them had never done dishes before and I had to show him how to wash, rinse and dry. These skills, simple housekeeping, shopping, budgeting and cleaning, were things I picked up because I was living in residence. And if I didn't get it right away, so what? I was living with four other guys who were learning too.
For stuff that we couldn't figure out on our own, we had dons to help us. The dons were upper-year students who lived in residence as well. Primarily they were there to deal with problems that arose after the residence staff left for the day. They had keys to all the houses and the residence offices in case someone lost theirs. They had first aid training in case of medical emergencies and they had some couselling training to help students deal with the inevitable conflicts that come from young people living together. If you had a problem, whether it was with school or with someone you lived with, you could go and see your don. If they couldn't help you, they could point you in the direction of someone who could.
In compensation for the duties the dons performed, they got free rooms on residence for the year, plus training and experience that would help them later on in their lives.
There are lots of other good things about living in residence, but for the sake of brevity, I'll just mention two more.
The first was the proximity of my home to the school. If I had a 9 a.m. class, I could roll out of bed at 8:30 and be in my seat, showered, combed and with a tea in hand, by 8:55. If I went drinking at the campus pub, I didn't have to worry about getting home safe. I was home. If I needed a change of location for studying, I had a whole school to hide in. If I got a bunch of books home for an essay and realized I had forgotten a key volume, I could just walk back and pick it up from the library (as long as it was before midnight). And last, but not least, if we ran out of toilet paper, there was a whole school full of well-stocked bathrooms to choose from. This may not seem important to you now, but it will. Trust me.
The second good thing about residence is that something is always going on in residence.
One afternoon during my last spring in school, I was making the usual five-minute walk from school to home through the residence village. People were sitting on picnic tables in front of their homes, playing guitar, talking, studying and relaxing. And because we were neighbours and had been for a whole year, we all knew each other. I didn't get home for two hours because I stopped at one house, talked to some people and then went to the next house.
That's what I miss most about living in residence, I think. Sometimes, when I'm walking through the corridors of my apartment building, I think about just opening a door at random, like I would have on campus, and walking in and sitting down. Maybe the people inside would be happy to see me. Maybe they'd talk to me about Third World debt, or the price, both economically and morally, of an oil-based economy, or how close the 1997 XF11 asteroid will come to hitting the earth.
Or maybe they'll stare at me blankly.
Or maybe they'll have a really, really big dog..","The dons were upper-year students who lived in residence as well.

There are several just depends on your experience level. IM Portal, Simple Portal, Stargate Portal, Integra Mod3. It should be noted here that IntegraMod comes already with Phpbb I do not remember if they have upgraded to 3 or not.

Simple Portal:
I would go to the Phpbb Website to find out more about this I say that because a lot of these come with the forum already in the package. And I personally do not know if an existing forum could be imported into them.
Another thing Google it that will bring up a lot.
I quite like the board3 portal:
It's also previously been validated by the phpBB team:
Are there anymore portal options for phpbb?
I've been thinking about helping a client setup a small phpbb forum and they'll want a portal or cms type system that they could show news similar to how we have our home page setup.
I think the Board3 Portal should serve that purpose, then again there are also other choices available out there as well
Is that this site here?
That looks pretty nice
I couldn't find the portal that I used years ago, I think it had an alien as their mascot or logo.

"What was the reaction of the Florida state attorney's office to the incident involving a teacher and a boy with Asperger's Syndrome in St. Lucie, Florida?","A teacher in St. Lucie, Florida, did just this in her kindergarten class. As a five-year-old boy, who is in the process of being diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, was forced to stand at the front of the room, his classmates were each given a turn to say what they disliked about him. They described him with words including ""disgusting"" and ""annoying,"" then voted 14-2 to make him leave the classroom; he spent the rest of the day banished to the nurse's office. The Florida state attorney's office says this treatment does not qualify as emotional abuse and is not pursuing criminal charges against the teacher. The district says it is ""investigating"" the incident (which teacher Wendy Portillo has admitted) but has not yet taken any action.
The boy has refused to return to school since then; and if I were his mother, I can't imagine why I would even try to make him go back.
Since our children are not (surprise!) completely socially isolated, we attend classes two days a week at Village Home. One of the most heartening things I've observed in our time there is the way that all kids--the loud ones, the quiet ones, the ones of varying cognitive and social ability, the ones who I am pretty sure have been or could be diagnosed as autistic--are treated as just part of the group. There are special friendships, sure; but I haven't seen poisonous cliques, I haven't seen shunning, I haven't seen my kids or anyone else's deliberately leave someone out because of personal differences.
And I know when I tell my boys about this little boy in Florida, they will be as horrified as anyone should be. As horrified as the students in that class should have been. Because no one's ever told them that you have to do what the grownup says just because the grownup is a grownup. Because no one's managed to convince them yet that different = bad and that cruelty = a good way of dealing with difference. And I hope to god that no one ever can.
Oh my gosh! :( That is the saddest thing I've ever heard. Yes, I am quite horrified.
I was just walking through Village the other day, and watched the ""cafe"" kids sell their snacks. One of the boys, P., is special. You might have noticed him. He usually wears a long black trench coat. He's a big kid, and slower than the others. He is one of the friendliest kids I've ever met. He will perform in the play at summerfest, as he has last year. He is not a great actor, but he's funny, and he loves it. And he is accepted in the group, just like any other kid. This is heart warming. This is what makes me so proud to be a part of that community. :)
I will not leave this place until my kids tell me they're tired of Village.
Posted by: Ute | May 26, 2008 at 01:54 PM
This is so sad. And if it's not emotional abuse I don't know what is. And not only did the teacher do damage to the poor boy, but to all his classmates. Surely some of them knew what they were doing was wrong and felt bad about it.
This woman doesn't need to be around kids period. Maybe someone should make her stand in front of a group of her peers while they tell her what a disgusting human being she is.
Posted by: Alasandra | May 26, 2008 at 04:57 PM
Holy cow. That is just reprehensible.
Posted by: Helena | May 26, 2008 at 05:33 PM
That is horrible. The fact that it is a story means that EVERYONE recognizes it as horrible. It is an aberration, even in (gasp) public school. I can't imagine a single teacher I know doing such a thing. And of course, that teacher ought to be fired. She doesn't belong in a classroom.
There are lots of reasons that homeschooling might be a good idea for many kids (NCLB, lack of arts and physical education, etc), but this is so out-there that I can't imagine it qualifies.
Posted by: Herm | May 27, 2008 at 07:51 AM
I agree that this incident is an aberration (though, sadly, a read-through on the comments at the original story reveals that there's a not-insignificant number of people who think this is a good example of bringing back discipline to the classroom). But I think the ganging-up, bullying mentality is not uncommon, not among students and not even among teachers. I definitely remember having more than one teacher who enjoyed embarrassing or shaming students in front of the rest of the class.
And I think the fact that even the few students who felt uncomfortable with the scenario ended up going along with it speaks volumes about the inappropriate power relationship that exists in many classrooms and schools. The teacher's word is law, even when that word is stupid, cruel or just plain wrong. Definitely not all schools, or all classrooms; but one doesn't really get to pick one's child's learning environment when the child enters a school system away from home.
That said, I definitely agree with you that this by itself would not be a valid reason to consider homeschooling if no other factors were in play. Just another drop in the proverbial bucket, proverbially.
Posted by: RedMolly | May 27, 2008 at 03:11 PM
I think behavior like this is more common that you would think. Yes, I am sure there are wonderful, caring teachers out there, ( i.e. My incredible little sister who just received her Masters in Special Education and who received the Teacher of the Year Award for her county after only 2 years of teaching!! :) ) I think stuff like this happens more often than is reported. In 6th grade I let loose a fart to beat the band. Unfortunately, I didn't possess the sense of humor about that stuff that I do now, and was humilated when the class laughed at me. It could have stopped there, but my A-hole, Chauvinistic teacher made me stand in front of the class and admit I was the culprit. He then began to question my eating habits, my manners and upbringing, then excused me to the principals office to "" think "" about what I had done. As I fled the classroom I distinctly remember him spraying Lysol around my desk, much to merriment of my classmates.
I've never forgotten his unkindness. You can bet this child won't forget hers.

What is the main goal of the Art from the Heart organization?,"Artful expression, from the heart
Disabled artists come together for Walters exhibit
Artists ply their trades for a number of reasons, whether it's painting as a way to make money or sculpting as a means of expressing deep and complex thoughts.
At Portland-based art school Art from the Heart, the process of creating art has become a way for developmentally disabled adults to build social skills while simultaneously learning ways to express themselves through a number of media.
Established in 1990, Art from the Heart offers classes in a wide array of media - from painting and drawing to encaustics, ceramics, bookmaking, music, theater and beyond.
The overarching goal of the organization is to provide developmentally disabled adults with a way to connect with one another as a community while also exploring their own creative spirits.
The results, says program director Emily Conradson, are often a delightful surprise.
'I really am surprised with the quality, especially when they try new media,' says Conradson. 'It's so interesting and versatile. I'm surprised when people want to focus on drawing and painting, and then you give them a new media to work with and they love it.'
Throughout September, two dozen pieces of artwork from Art from the Heart are on display at Hillsboro's Walters Cultural Arts Center. The exhibit marks the group's first show in the city.
Through the program, students of Art from the Heart are exposed to multiple media and offered the chance to try their hands at many different styles.
Unlike many art classes, however, Art from the Heart's focus on working together as a community helps its participants branch out into many different levels of expression, creating an environment where art becomes less a solitary endeavor and more a social event.
'A lot of artists do work in isolation, including me. But this is really a way to connect with other people and find the common point where they can work together,' Conradson said.
'The artists are creating in a social environment. People are proud of their artwork, and they want to share their work with other people. People definitely influence each other in terms of subject matter, and in trying things.'
Conradson says the program also offers a unique challenge for the staff, which is tasked with fostering the sense of community while also urging its attendees to express complex ideas and emotions through art.
With so many different personality types and levels of disability, she says it can sometimes be difficult to maintain focus. But once that focus is honed, she says, beautiful things result.
'We deal more with socialization, the day-to-day building of social skills,' says Conradson. 'We have 29-31 artists scheduled to attend every day, so that's a lot of personalities. Hopefully on top of (socializing) we can actually get together well enough where we can make some artwork.
'If we're going to be creating work in the same environment, then everybody needs to be OK with everybody before you can focus on what you're doing. The classes and the structure help with that goal.'
At the end of the day, Conradson and her team are almost always able to help the students of the organization find themselves as artists. The proof of the program's success is literally on the walls of the school's in-house gallery, and in the halls of the Walters Center.
'It's all over the place,' says Conradson. 'Not everyone has the same interests and abilities. We try to keep it very broad so that people can try new things, and to keep it interesting for the staff so we get to play too and continue to help people grow as individual artists. Their work is just amazing.'

What are some of the guidelines for disciplining a teenager?,"In the light of all the discussion about disciplining your child that the NFL has created, I think this is a good time to talk about how to discipline teenagers, since it is very different from how you would discipline a young child.
When disciplining a teenager you need to remember that the actions that you take when your child breaks the rules are actions that will hopefully help your child learn. Parents question how much “rope” to give a child, worrying that there might be too much, and the child will “hang himself.” Other parent’s worry that being too strict will result in their teen rebelling, losing respect, and not loving them. Others consider rebellion and defiance to be “normal” in teenagers and thus may rarely take a teen’s misbehavior seriously. While to some degree rebellion and defiance are natural, it has been found that excessive rebellion and excessive defiance are usually indicators of an oppositional defiant behavior disorder and are not necessarily associated with health.
The problem is that most parents only have the model of discipline that was meted out to them as children and teens. For many, identification with the normal rebellious and defiant aspects of the teenage years has never been normalized by mature growth; thus they either subtly (or not so subtly) stimulate “bad behavior,” only to follow it, in their own anxiety and confusion, by administering punishment to the adolescent. Not surprisingly, this causes the teen perplexity, anxiety, and confusion.
On the other hand, constructive discipline tends to result in the development of a mature young adult by the end of the adolescent passage. It helps a teenager control his impulses, cooperate with other people, and be patient. The aim of discipline should not be to develop a homogenized and completely socialized teenager; parents should always stress the uniqueness of their teenage sons and daughters. Rather, discipline should result in a teen taking a wholehearted and responsible approach to life. Disciplining a teenager is different from disciplining a younger child since the teenager is more mature, more reflective, and more able to enter into discussions and negotiations. This means that discipline can and should always be enlightening to teenagers, never a means of deriding, shaming, or making them feel as if they are “bad.”
What to Do
- Don’t be a cruel parent. Don’t humiliate, criticize destructively, physically attack, or try to cripple your teenagers will just in order to make him conform to certain rules.
- Make expectations and rules clear to your child.
- Don’t be scared to set limits.
- Do not make rules arbitrarily, even if you feel strong about them; they should involve some give and take.
- Understand that whatever teaching and disciplining you do, most teenagers will mature through trial and error.
- Reward constructive behavior rather than criticize bad behavior.
- Be a role model for your teenager.
- Be compassionate and patient when it comes to discussion of family rules and responsibilities.
- When punishing your teenager it is best to withdraw privileges. However, make sure to not over-punish because you are angry.
- Never use physical or mental torture.

What is the theory of Panspermia and who first proposed it?,"A team of scientists from Sheffield University believe that they may have discovered extraterrestrial life. According to this story on MSN News a group from the University’s department of molecular biology and biotechnology under Professor Milton Wainwright sent a balloon 27 km up into the stratosphere during the recent Perseid meteor shower. The balloon was launched from Chester and came down near Wakefield. The balloon carried microscope studs, which were set to open between 22 and 27 km above the Earth. To ensure that the results were not contaminated by organisms from the Earth’s surface, the equipment was sterilised before it was launched.
When it returned, it was found that the studs had collected a variety of microscopic organisms. Some were diatoms, a form of algae, along with more unusual life-forms. Prof Wainwright said “It is generally accepted that a particle of the size found cannot be lifted from Earth to heights of, for example, 27km.!”
The team’s finding appears to corroborate the highly controversial views of the origin and evolution of life on Earth of the late Sir Fred Hoyle and his colleague, Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe. Panspermia is the theory that life originated in space and later colonised Earth. It was first put forward in the 19th century by the Swedish astronomer, Svante Aarhenius. In the late 1970s and early ’80s another creatures here on Earth.
Most controversially, they suggested in the last book. More speculatively still, they suggested that the seeding of such genetic material on Earth was done deliberately by advanced extraterrestrial civilisations. They suggested that these would artificial, machine intelligences from another cosmos in the multiverse..
This is not the first time a scientific balloon has returned from the stratosphere containing what was suggested was extraterrestrial microbial life. A few years a balloon sent up by scientists in India returned to Earth with red slime. Like Prof Wainwright, the Indian scientists believed this material had been collected from too high an altitude for it to have come from the Earth. They came to the conclusion that it must therefore have come from space. Fred Hoyle died twenty or so years ago in the 1990s. The media did contact Chandra Wickramasinghe, who was then working at Cardiff University, if I recall correctly. Prof Wickramasinghe was delighted that there was now further evidence to support his and Sir Fred’s theory.
Meanwhile, Prof Wainwright’s team intend to repeat the experiment in October, when there is a meteor shower associated with Halley’s Comet. This will spread further cosmic dust. If the balloon returns again with similar material, it will confirm the team’s theory.
All this is fascinating and highly controversial. I don’t think, however, there’s any remote chance of them finding anything like the horrific extraterrestrial disease in Michael Creighton’s book and film, The Andromeda Strain.

What is the main statement of the Equal Rights Amendment?,"March is Women’s History month. And today, March 8, is International Women’s Day. But here in the United States, women still do not have equal rights. In women’s marches, older women now hold signs that say “I can’t believe I still have to protest this fucking shit” and “My arms are tired from holding this sign since the 1960s.”
Nothing illustrates women’s inequality better than the failure of the Equal Rights Amendment to be ratified. It was first introduced in Congress almost a century ago in 1923.[1] But it took Congress 49 years to pass it.[2] For an amendment to become part of the Constitution, 2/3 of the state legislatures must then vote to ratify it. But only 37 states have done so – one vote short of the needed total. [3] In the 47 years since Congress passed it,[4] 13 states have refused to support women’s equality.
Even worse, five states have rescinded their ratification of the ERA.[5] Because it is unclear that states have the power to rescind a ratification, it remains to be seen if these actions set the ERA back even further.[6] Moreover, the original deadline for ratification of 1979 and an extension to 1982 has passed, so Congress would need to extend the deadline.[7] Recently, bills have been introduced to do just that.[8]
The latest state to fail to ratify the ERA is the Commonwealth of Virginia. In light of the scandals that have plagued three highest officials in the state,[9] including accusations of sexual assault,[10] this state could have improved its reputation by ratifying the ERA. Instead, it was never brought to a full vote before the Virginia legislature.[11]
What is so scandalous about this amendment that has made its passage impossible in almost a century? It says only this: “Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.”[12] It simply requires that men and women be treated equally. How can anyone oppose gender equality?
The opposition’s reasons for opposing the ERA consist mainly of quaint paternalistic notions that have been nullified with the passage of time and new laws. The latest reason is that “tax dollars could be used for abortion.”[13] In support of this argument, opponents cite a New Mexico state case, New Mexico Right to Choose/NARAL v. Johnson.[14] They claim that this case ruled that “since abortion is unique to women, restricting abortions is a form of sex discrimination.”[15] But that is not the ruling in this case. In fact, the ruling turned on medically necessary treatment, including abortion, being made available to women equally to men, not the fact that “abortion is unique to women.” 975 P.2d 841 (1998).
Opponents to the ERA also claim that supporters want to overturn all restrictions on abortions based purely on their rejection of pro-lifers’ proposed amendment to the ERA: “Nothing in this Article shall be construed to grant or secure any right relating to abortion or the funding thereof.”[16] But equal rights have nothing to do with abortion where only women can have an abortion. If men were being provided abortions and women were not, equal rights would have indeed required that abortions be provided to women in the same way. But of course that is not the case So this provision was rejected because it is irrelevant to the ERA.
Opponents make other claims as well. For example, they claim that women are paid 98% of men’s earnings and that these statistics are not meaningful because they do not consider occupation.[17] But when occupation is considered, the gap widens.[18]
They also claim that current laws are working and that women are already getting equal treatment. If that were true, why are they opposing a constitutional amendment that would merely formalize laws already in place? Perhaps it is because current laws are not working. Look at the Equal Pay Act.
Last, opponents of the ERA claim that it will end preferential treatment for women embedded in current laws, like those that benefit pregnant women.[19] This argument suffers from the same flaw as that for abortion – men cannot get pregnant so equal treatment between pregnant men and women is impossible. The ERA will not change that.
Opponents also claim without support that all bathrooms will be unisex if the ERA is enacted.[20] Equality is related to the number of bathrooms; it does not require the same bathroom.
If a person opposes the ERA, then that person believes that men and women are not equal. In the United States, the ceiling for women is not glass; it is clearly visible in the form of a Constitution that fails to provide for gender equality. Until the ERA is enacted, women are second-class citizens in this country.

When was Thunder's new album “Robert Johnson’s Tombstone” released?,"Thunder’s new album “Robert Johnson’s Tombstone” is released on 30th October on STC Recordings (via Universal). The band will tour the UK in November to support the new release.
The band have played 2 UK tours, 2 European Tours, done lots of festivals and finished off with a triumphant appearance at the Monsters of Rock Festival in Milton Keynes in June. They’ve recently released their fourth self financed DVD – a double affair called “Thunder Go Mad In Japan” – which, as the title suggests, was filmed on tour in Japan in February 2006. Disc 1 contains a documentary of the trip, and Disc 2 features a full blown 2 hour show. Harry performed with Ian Gillan at the Teenage Cancer Trust show at). The campaign for the new LP is gathering pace, and full details of all their activities can be found as ever at.”
Formed at the turn of 1989, Thunder have enjoyed an eventful career that has thankfully witnessed more highs than lows. The release of “Robert Johnson’s Tombstone” finds the quintet on a very remarkable high, and in a position where they are pretty much masters of their own destiny.
Having known each other since they were 11 and been playing in bands together since they were 15, Danny and Luke knew exactly what they were going for when they began demo-ing tracks with Duran Duran guitarist Andy Taylor producing. With Harry James occupying the drum stool, bass player Mark “Snake” Luckhurst and guitarist/keyboardist Ben Matthews swiftly joined the trio, and by this time a record deal had been inked with EMI. Debuting in front of a mere 35 punters at a gig in Southend in July 1989, they did a handful of shows before the band entered the studio with Taylor and engineer Mike Fraser (Bryan Adams, Aerosmith etc) to cut their first magnificent offering in the shapely form of debut album 'Backstreet Symphony'. More touring followed, including two dates at the NEC in Birmingham opening for Aerosmith, and the band's fondness for the road would only increase their popularity. “In our previous band Terraplane,” notes Luke, “we never got any support from radio and TV and with Thunder we just assumed the worst. So”/Fraser produced second album, 'Laughing On Judgement Day' was released in August 1992 (held off the Number One spot in the UK's album chart only by a Kylie Minogue greatest hits package).
However, the tour to support 'Laughing On Judgement Day' (which included headlining dates in the UK and a European tour supporting Extreme) proved a step too far for bassist Snake. He quit after Japanese dates.….
“I don't think we were particularly affected by Grunge in terms of musical influence,” reckons Luke. .
The band's first official live album, 'Live', hit the stores in February 1998 and the quintet toured the UK once again, and doing another couple of bits for charity by abseiling off of the side of the Tyne Bridge in Newcastle for the British Lung Foundation (not Luke - he hates heights), and doing a freefall parachute jump (Danny & Ben). Thunder are, of course, no strangers to charity, having organised several highly publicised gigs in aid of CRISIS in the past. Surprisingly, eight months after the release of the next studio album, 'Giving The Game Away', in 1998, Thunder announced a split due to “outside business forces”, going out in typical style with a series of farewell shows, climaxing with two gigs at Dingwalls in Camden on May 4 and 5 2000.
Danny “We’d been at it solidly for eleven years, we were still doing great touring business and we were solid as a unit, but we felt frustrated. There didn't seem to be any room for us to operate outside of our own fanbase..
“I'd had the idea of the 'Monsters Of Rock' tour and took the concept to Clear Channel. I convinced them it was a workable thing to do, thinking that my role would be behind the scenes, and just walking around telling people what to do!
“But they felt Thunder should reform and be on the bill. ‘It would be great for ticket sales’, they said. settled on an EP to start with. When the news got out, we were offered record deals, but with the advances in technology and the internet,...”
“The thing is, we never fell out, we’d all remained good friends,” continues Luke.  'Back For The Crack' EP sold incredibly well, as did the 'Shooting At The Sun' album. Amazingly the fans were still there and they’ve continued to grow throughout the campaign for 'The Magnificent Seventh', and all the touring we’ve done with it”
Indeed. Onward and upward and there's clearly no chance of Thunder joining the derelict old barflies up on Boot Hill just yet!
Luke “There was a period just after the whole Brit-Pop thing in the late 90s when we were truly out of sorts. But rock is back, and we're having a great time, and what’s even better, now we’re doing it all on our own terms.”
Danny “There’s no doubt it’s very hard work doing this all ourselves, but the rewards are there with each record selling more than the last, so we can see the curve going upwards, and it's great not to have to deal with all the record label bullshit, now it’s my bullshit, and everyone else has to deal with it!”",Thunder's new album “Robert Johnson’s Tombstone” was released on 30th October.,good,
Who scored the first touchdown for the Eagles in the NFC Divisional Playoff against the Giants?,"Our grades for the Eagles victory over the Giants in the NFC Divisional Playoff:
RUSHING OFFENSE
The Eagles averaged just 2.1 yards per carry, but they get points for again sticking with the run (28 attempts). Donovan McNabb scored the Eagles’ first TD on a QB sneak and Brian Westbrook set up the Eagles’ second TD with a 4-yard gain on a third-and-1 third-quarter toss play. Grade: C
PASSING OFFENSE
Donovan McNabb threw 2 interceptions and completed just 55 percent of his passes, but engineered two game-changing, third-quarter scoring drives that turned an 11-10 deficit into a 20-11 lead. He completed 9 of 16 passes for 93 yards and 7 passing first downs on those two drives. Grade: B-minus
RUN DEFENSE
Brandon Jacobs and Derrick Ward combined for 138 rushing yards, but the Eagles contained the damage and stopped them when they had to. DT Brodrick Bunkley spearheaded 2 huge fourth-and-one stops in the fourth quarter. Grade: B-plus
PASS DEFENSE
The Eagles effectively shut down the Giants’ passing game, holding Eli Manning to 5.8 yards per attempt, intercepting 2 passes, including 1 by Asante Samuel that set up the Eagles’ first touchdown, and held their fifth straight opponent without a passing TD. Grade: A
SPECIAL TEAMS
Ahmad Bradshaw gashed the Eagles for a game-opening 65-yard kickoff return that set up the Giants’ first points, but did a good job after that. Sav Rocca had a 40.0 net average and pinned the Giants at their own 11 on an important fourth-quarter punt. David Akers made all three of his field goal attempts. Grade: B
OVERALL
Once upon a time, the Eagles didn’t win many games in which Brian Westbrook managed just 46 rushing and receiving yards and Donovan McNabb threw 2 interceptions. But with a defense that hasn’t given up more than 14 points in the last 6 games, all bets are off.

The overarching goal of the organization is to provide developmentally disabled adults with a way to connect with one another as a community while also exploring their own creative spirits.
The results, says program director Emily Conradson, are often a delightful surprise.
'I really am surprised with the quality, especially when they try new media,' says Conradson. 'It's so interesting and versatile. I'm surprised when people want to focus on drawing and painting, and then you give them a new media to work with and they love it.'
Throughout September, two dozen pieces of artwork from Art from the Heart are on display at Hillsboro's Walters Cultural Arts Center. The exhibit marks the group's first show in the city.
Through the program, students of Art from the Heart are exposed to multiple media and offered the chance to try their hands at many different styles.
Unlike many art classes, however, Art from the Heart's focus on working together as a community helps its participants branch out into many different levels of expression, creating an environment where art becomes less a solitary endeavor and more a social event.
'A lot of artists do work in isolation, including me. But this is really a way to connect with other people and find the common point where they can work together,' Conradson said.
'The artists are creating in a social environment. People are proud of their artwork, and they want to share their work with other people. People definitely influence each other in terms of subject matter, and in trying things.'
Conradson says the program also offers a unique challenge for the staff, which is tasked with fostering the sense of community while also urging its attendees to express complex ideas and emotions through art.
With so many different personality types and levels of disability, she says it can sometimes be difficult to maintain focus. But once that focus is honed, she says, beautiful things result.
'We deal more with socialization, the day-to-day building of social skills,' says Conradson. 'We have 29-31 artists scheduled to attend every day, so that's a lot of personalities. Hopefully on top of (socializing) we can actually get together well enough where we can make some artwork.
'If we're going to be creating work in the same environment, then everybody needs to be OK with everybody before you can focus on what you're doing. The classes and the structure help with that goal.'
At the end of the day, Conradson and her team are almost always able to help the students of the organization find themselves as artists. The proof of the program's success is literally on the walls of the school's in-house gallery, and in the halls of the Walters Center.
'It's all over the place,' says Conradson. 'Not everyone has the same interests and abilities. We try to keep it very broad so that people can try new things, and to keep it interesting for the staff so we get to play too and continue to help people grow as individual artists. Their work is just amazing.'

What are some of the challenges Amy Bloom faces when starting a significant writing project?,"Steven G. Smith for The Boston Globe
Author Amy Bloom relaxes on her couch in her writing room.
Amy Bloom writes novels, short stories, and screenplays. Her last novel, “Away,” won international acclaim with its epic saga of a Russian immigrant mourning her parents while traipsing across America. The sisters at the heart of her novel, slated for release this week, “Lucky Us,” are equally peripatetic, embarking on a road trip from the Midwest to Hollywood. Bloom lives near New Haven, Conn., with her family.
NUTMEG STATE: I’ve lived in Connecticut most of my adult life. I’m sure I could live other places, too, but I like Connecticut. As the state [nickname] so proudly says, “The land of Steady Habits.” I find that very appealing.
PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY’S CREATOR: I write in a little space that is over the only market in my town between the antique store and the coffee shop. It’s on the second floor, and you can’t really run up the stairs because they’re dark and lopsided. I have a kitchen table, which is my desk, a couch, and a big portrait of Oscar Wilde as a young man, which is a print I’ve had with me now for, I think, for 40 years. I love the photograph of him . . . He’s sitting on a pile of Turkish rugs, and he’s very young, probably in his early 20s. He’s beautiful.
SEX AND CANDY: As Michael Cunningham once said, if it’s a good day you can write in a discotheque; if it’s a bad day you can’t write in a monastery. I don’t really need to have anything around me except a desk and paper and a pen . . . [and] a little figure of Ganesh dancing on top of my desk. He tends to travel with me, because who does not want the god of intellectual curiosity, perseverance and sex and candy with you at all times?
FINNEGAN’S NOTEBOOK: I try to keep track of my notes, but I never do. I must have 9,000 notebooks hanging around. No doubt when I die, someone will be able to put these together in some kind of terrific “Finnegan’s Wake’’-like 900-page novel.
LIKE DEAR OLD DAD: My dad was a journalist and a freelance magazine writer my whole life. He got up at noon and read the mail, took the dog for a walk, sat back down again and worked until 5:30. That was five days a week and sometimes six. There was no suggestion that writing was glamorous or fancy or that you would be famous or special. It was a job, a job like being a plumber or any other kind of job, except that he worked at home, and if he didn’t work he didn’t get paid. He was a great role model. Sometimes other writers will talk about how they always dreamt of being a writer. I never dreamt of being a writer; it looked like really hard work. Relative to other lines of work, it’s a walk in the park, but I think that that it was helpful that it didn’t look glamorous.
THE HARD PART: Getting started is hard; a great middle is hard; a good ending is hard — it’s sort of dealer’s choice, here. But I think the act of kind of lowering myself into the well of a significant project is hardest; I have to clear a space mentally and in my life, and recalibrate everything I’m doing and then just climb down the ladder into whatever well that is. Once I’m underway, I’m pretty much down to business, but getting underway I can go back and forth and delude myself and rearrange all sorts of domestic details for quite an extended period of time . . . It means that I’m going to be less involved in my everyday life, which I happen to like quite a bit. If anyone has ever suggested that a happy domestic life makes it easier to write, I’d like to hear about it. I see fewer people; I do fewer things; I’m a little less engaged. I don’t spend much time thinking about what I’m going to make for dinner for my family. That’s a loss. It’s a clearing away, and there’s something very good about that, but it’s also a loss.

What does the author believe is the key to creating a connection between the reader and the characters in a story?,"/>~ By Jim Cangany
There’s a line in John Green’s beloved The Fault in Our Stars that has rooted itself in my head and won’t go away. “That’s the thing about pain. It demands to be felt.”
Recently, I’ve been thinking a lot about that line and how it applies to romance writers. I think we’d agree that in romance, the hero, or heroine, or both, need to survive pain in some sort before they get to enjoy their happily-ever-after. The pain may be physical, if the paramedic heroine is injured while trying to save a child’s life, for example. It could emotional too, if the hero has lost the ability to trust after finding out his former spouse was cheating on him. The point is the pain has to be dealt with and overcome, or we’d be left with pretty boring stories.
So, as authors, where do we find that pain? Even more important, how do we transfer that pain to the page once we’ve found it? In my opinion, we don’t have to look far. A glance in the mirror will suffice. After all, who among us has not battled, and hopefully defeated, pain at one time or another? It could be anything from a stubbed toe to an extended stay in the hospital. He or she who has not felt pain has not truly lived.
Contemporary romance authors write stories about “real” people. While they may be more muscle-bound or have better hair than the majority of us in the flesh-and-blood world, those characters still struggle with the everyday struggles we face–sick children, aging parents, a friend’s unexpected death.
Our job as writers is to get the reader to care about our characters. What better way is there to create that connection than to draw on our own experiences? Sure we’re paid to make stuff up. But romance readers are smart, and can spot a lack of genuineness a mile away. (Just to be safe, I consulted the dictionary and genuineness is a real word. Trust me.)
When I wrote Fallen Star, the toughest scene for me to write was when E.J.’s mother passed away. Why was it so hard? It was difficult because to write the way it needed to be written, I went back to the time when my mom died. While my mom’s passing was much different from E.J.’s, the helplessness, the anguish, the pain was the same. I needed to channel all of those emotions into that scene to make sure it was a genuine as possible.
I was in tears when I finished writing that scene. But you know what? Readers have told me that sequence left them in tears, as well. That, my friends, is what it’s all about. When you’ve dug so deep into your own mine of troubles that the reader actually feels it too, then you’ve dug deep enough.
Given that nobody likes to revisit bad times, so one may ask why do it. I believe we should do it because as storytellers we are in the unique position to tell the truth. We are the ones who strip away the veneer to reveal what lies beneath. And when we have done so, and made our readers seethe in anger, or shed a tear in grief, we have made the payoff–the hero and heroine’s happily-ever-after–that much more worthy of celebration.
My editor has told me that I have a knack for making her cry. It’s an unusual compliment, but one of which I am quite proud. I’m proud of it because that means I’ve done my job well. I’ve searched within myself, brought forth some of that pain we all carry, and transferred it to the page in a way that someone else feels it.
The ability to have our words bring forth a specific emotional response from somebody we’ve never met is pretty darn cool. It may not be easy. It may not be fun. But it is so worth the heartache, because at the end of the story, when our hero and heroine have fought the good fight, that happily-ever-after they finally achieved is sweeter than a June strawberry.
So my challenge to my fellow authors is this–dig deep. And when in doubt, dig a little deeper. By doing so, I guarantee you’ll hit that vein of elusive emotional gold that can be so hard to find. And your readers will thank you for it. In closing, I’d like to leave you with an old Irish prayer that captures the essence of this topic quite elegantly, I think.
May God give you…
For every storm, a rainbow,
For every tear, a smile,
For every care, a promise,
And a blessing in each trial.
For every problem life sends,
A faithful friend to share,
For every sigh, a sweet song,
And an answer for each prayer.

Gutter repairs are considered as not huge repairs compared to repairing or replacing
the whole roof. I think the reporter did put this story together but it didn’t seem to flow very well and it left too many unanswered

Great post, Jim, and I loved that quote.
The Irish certainly have a way with words, don’t they Liz. I have a file of Irish saying for situations just like that.
Great post. There’s a huge difference between reading a sad scene as an outsider and feeling a sad scene as though you were the character experiencing the emotions. It sounds like you’ve mastered the latter.
Thanks, Veronica.

What were the responsibilities of the dons in the residence?,"By Rob Taylor
I lived in a village of townhouses, each separate with four bedrooms, one or two bathrooms, a kitchen and a living room. Depending on where you were in the village, you could have anywhere from four-six people living in your house. You might also have a single room or a double room. Chances were if you were a student in first or second year, you'd be sharing a room.
I found out that the set-up at my school was unusual when I went to visit my friends who were attending other schools. Most often they lived in dormitory-style residences. On each floor of a large building, about 15-20 students would share a living area with a television and a small kitchen and a group bathroom with shower stalls. The kitchen didn't need to be large, as the students were required to buy into a meal plan from the cafeteria.
In my residence, there were no meal plans. So that meant that while my friends had to dish out about $3,000 more up front for a meal plan, that was money I got to hold on to until I actually bought my food. The drawback was that at the end of the year I had to make choices between a haircut and food. Look through your parent's pictures of when they were in school. Look how big their hair is. I bet most students have to make those kinds of decisions.
On many occasions I had some of my friends over to study at my house because it was conveniently located on campus. I cooked them dinner on the condition that they do dishes after. They all still lived at home and drove to school every day. To my amazement, one of them had never done dishes before and I had to show him how to wash, rinse and dry. These skills, simple housekeeping, shopping, budgeting and cleaning, were things I picked up because I was living in residence. And if I didn't get it right away, so what? I was living with four other guys who were learning too.
For stuff that we couldn't figure out on our own, we had dons to help us. The dons were upper-year students who lived in residence as well. Primarily they were there to deal with problems that arose after the residence staff left for the day. They had keys to all the houses and the residence offices in case someone lost theirs. They had first aid training in case of medical emergencies and they had some couselling training to help students deal with the inevitable conflicts that come from young people living together. If you had a problem, whether it was with school or with someone you lived with, you could go and see your don. If they couldn't help you, they could point you in the direction of someone who could.
In compensation for the duties the dons performed, they got free rooms on residence for the year, plus training and experience that would help them later on in their lives.
There are lots of other good things about living in residence, but for the sake of brevity, I'll just mention two more.
The first was the proximity of my home to the school. If I had a 9 a.m. class, I could roll out of bed at 8:30 and be in my seat, showered, combed and with a tea in hand, by 8:55. If I went drinking at the campus pub, I didn't have to worry about getting home safe. I was home. If I needed a change of location for studying, I had a whole school to hide in. If I got a bunch of books home for an essay and realized I had forgotten a key volume, I could just walk back and pick it up from the library (as long as it was before midnight). And last, but not least, if we ran out of toilet paper, there was a whole school full of well-stocked bathrooms to choose from. This may not seem important to you now, but it will. Trust me.
The second good thing about residence is that something is always going on in residence.
One afternoon during my last spring in school, I was making the usual five-minute walk from school to home through the residence village. People were sitting on picnic tables in front of their homes, playing guitar, talking, studying and relaxing. And because we were neighbours and had been for a whole year, we all knew each other. I didn't get home for two hours because I stopped at one house, talked to some people and then went to the next house.
That's what I miss most about living in residence, I think. Sometimes, when I'm walking through the corridors of my apartment building, I think about just opening a door at random, like I would have on campus, and walking in and sitting down. Maybe the people inside would be happy to see me. Maybe they'd talk to me about Third World debt, or the price, both economically and morally, of an oil-based economy, or how close the 1997 XF11 asteroid will come to hitting the earth.
Or maybe they'll stare at me blankly.
Or maybe they'll have a really, really big dog..","The dons were upper-year students who lived in residence as well.

Who was the pitcher for the Elk River Pioneers who injured his ankle during a practice?,"The Elk River Pioneers took a 16-5 drubbing from St. Michael on Friday night in a game where the winner would clinch advancement to next week’s super-regional.

Ning, who stepped up his game after last week's silver medal in the Poland leg of the World Cup, said the gold medal will boost his confidence before the 2022 Winter Olympics begin in Beijing on Feb. 4. ""It's very important for me to win this medal. It gives me great confidence for the Olympic year going forward,"" Ning said in a statement. ""Yes, there's some degree of pressure for sure with the Olympics in China but I believe athletes from other countries have pressure too."" World Champion Thomas Krol and Olympic champion Kjeld Nuis had yet another disappointing week, with the Dutchmen finishing fifth and seventh, respectively. Japan celebrated three gold medals on Sunday, thanks to Tatsuya Shinhama, Nao Kodaira and Miho Takagi. Shinhama won his second 500m race of the new World Cup season, though Canada's Laurent Dubreuil held on to the lead in the rankings after finishing second.

What is the author's view on traditional gender roles in marriage?,"Someone please give the woman in this picture a drink.
4 Comments:
it is still to small to see. but what is so funny about it. whats wrong with wanting to be a good wife? didn't you say you were married before?
I'll see if I can adjust it to make the image larger. In the meantime, there's nothing wrong with wanting to be a good wife. It's just that the definitions of both ""good"" and ""wife"" need to be evaluated. This guide I've posted here was published in 1955, and the definitions of those words are pretty antiquated by now--which is what's humorous to me. Well, I'd like to think they're antiquated, but are they? I'm not always so sure.
Yes, I was married before, and I could not be a good partner for my then-husband, because it wasn't the right life for me to be living. However, the partner I
had hoped to be when I first got married looked nothing like the woman in this guide here, nor did my ex expect me to be like that. These ideals from 1955 are false and misogynistic, claiming that the wife is subservient to and less important than the husband. That's pure bullshit, and anyone who still strives for these ideals today has been brainwashed. It's sad.
Of course, lesbians and gays are doing all we can to make it legal to marry. However, I think one of the real reasons it's such a struggle is that when gay marriage finally becomes a national reality (and it someday will, even if not for decades), the public will not be able to just drop each person in the marriage into a pre-formed identity like ""husband"" or ""wife"" and, unfortunately, people are always most uncomfortable when they cannot categorize other people.
Incidentally, let me say that that is definitely a benefit to being gay: there are no traditional gender roles expected of either partner in a relationship. I do hope to eventually have a life-long partnership, a marriage, though it obviously won't look anything like the ""Good Wife's Guide"" here.
I would gladly go back to the submissive days if I didn't have to work. I would love to stay home and look 'pretty' for when my husband came home and all I did was cook all day. now maybe I have a Donna reed picture in my head but I think that there were better families, lower divorce rate and much less stress in general.
Obviously we differ in this view b/c for one I am not a feminist.
But I appreciate your honesty and the fact that you post your true feelings.
Oh I do have another question. Why do you keep in contact w/ your old girlfriend? I just figure she hurt you so why bother. Screw her, don’t' give her the satisfaction of talking to her.
One more question sorry - do you still talk to your ex husband? Did you get divorced b/c you realized that you weren’t being true to yourself and that you were gay? Did you always know? Sorry so many questions you just really have me thinking.
Don’t answer if you don't feel like it. I know they are pretty personal questions.
Actually, it's a myth that there was a lower divorce rate back in those ""simpler"" times. That's propaganda. Anyway, just because a marriage lasts, doesn't mean both people in it are happy. And, no, women were not happier then because they didn't ""have"" to work. Not ""having"" to work doesn't mean you have a simpler life; it means you have less control over your life. It means you don't make your own money. It means you are not able to pursue your own interests and strengths. It means you let other people make your decisions for you. It means all women are meant for the same things in life: being wives and having babies (there's nothing wrong with either of those, if it's what you truly want and you aren't giving up your identity to have them). It means your entire life is about making someone else's dreams come true (your husband's), not your own. It's a cop out. It means the work you do---raising children, keeping house--isn't appreciated or seen as real work (which it is). Staying home to look ""pretty"" for your husband makes you a sexual object, not a human being with a brain. Don't use marriage as a way to justify not wanting to work or not liking your career.
And there is nothing wrong with being a feminist, so don't approach it like it's a dirty word. The backlash over the past couple decades has made women feel it's wrong or ""unladylike"" to be a feminist. All feminism means is the belief that women are individuals, just as men, who should have the same opportunities and choices that men have (which we still don't have, despite what some would let you think). It is not about man-bashing or being anti-marriage or being a lesbian. It is simply about making sure women have choices in life.
I'm not trying to sound confrontational or mean, but this is a very important and emotionally charged topic for me, and I get really tired of women who have been brainwashed to think it's ok to be an object placed on this earth to make men's lives better, rather than their own.
Yes, I did end my marriage because I realized I'm gay, not exclusively because I'm a feminist or anti-marriage or anything like that. My ex-husband is a great person and was a great partner. But don't categorically lump my sexual orientation together with my being a feminist. Many straight, happily-married women feel the same way I do about feminism and the idea of gender roles.
I'd be happy to answer more of your questions in an email. The address you can use is heathers_blog_mail@yahoo.com.
And regarding my ex-girlfriend, not only was she my girlfriend, she had also become a very dear friend, and that's the part that's hard get over. It's easy to say screw her and move on.
